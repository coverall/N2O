2008-03-17 16:13  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_AutoSubmit_Select_Field.php: Use <span
	style="white-space:nowrap">...</span> instead of the old
	<nobr>...</nobr> way.

2008-03-14 10:04  patrick

	* CC_ErrorManager.php: Remove "client" from the error_log() string.

2008-03-14 10:03  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_Credit_Card_Field.php: Remove an error_log() call
	that was driving me crazy!!

2008-03-14 08:58  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_Email_Field.php: Removed some parentheses.

2008-03-14 08:57  patrick

2008-02-07 17:59  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_Credit_Card_Field.php: Allow one to force the
	masking of the number in getEditHTML().

2008-01-08 16:03  patrick

	the email subject. This way we can tag email alerts to correspond
	to a given application.

2008-01-08 13:42  patrick

	* CC_Database.php: Pass the query into openDatabase() so that if
	there is a connection error, we'll get that query in the alert
	email.

2007-09-14 11:01  mike

	* CC_Handlers/CC_Summary_Search_Handler.php: assume no where clause
	for download all...

2007-09-10 14:24  patrick

	* CC_Components/CC_Summary_Search_Component.php,
	CC_Handlers/CC_Summary_Search_Handler.php: Added
	setAssumeNoWhereClause() to CC_Summary_Search_Component. When set
	to true, it will always use add "where" before the query additions
	instead of looking to see if the string "where" exists in the
	query. This will work-around the problem with complex queries that
	contain subselects which have their own where clauses.

2007-08-01 11:56  patrick

	* CC_Summary.php: Finally fix those damn IE errors!

2007-07-26 22:17  jamie

	getRawSummary().

2007-07-19 20:36  jamie

	CC_Currency_Field for other currencies.

2007-07-19 10:11  patrick

	instead of relying on SID constant.

2007-07-19 10:09  patrick

	* CC_Handlers/CC_InternalRewriteUrl_Handler.php: SID constant
	doesn't seem to be set sometimes after using
	session_regenerate_id().

2007-07-16 11:35  jamie

	* CC_Application.php: Add ability to include an onSubmit handler to
	the CC_Form using setOnSubmit().

2007-06-06 11:59  mike

	* CC_Fields/CC_SelectList_Field.php: don't return nothing if there
	is a value for the select list (even though it may not be an item

	delimiter, so it's easy to put them veritcal &nbsp; or horizontal
	<br>

2007-05-01 18:03  jamie

	* CC_Fields/CC_TextArea_Field.php: Maxwords needs to get even if
	auto-link is off.

2007-04-26 12:02  jamie

	checkboxes. Use 1 for Yes, 0 for No.

2007-04-21 17:06  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_Multiple_SelectList_Field.php: A little fix in
	getEditHTML() to rid us of a warning.

2007-04-21 15:11  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_Multiple_SelectList_Field.php: Add support in
	getHTML() for id="" using CC_Field's setId().

2007-04-20 17:31  patrick

	* CC_Window.php: Fixed updateFieldsFromPage() such that if a field
	has associated fields, it defers validation until the end so that
	we have the updated values for the associated fields before the
	parent field is validated. No more cockamaney ordering of fields!!

2007-04-20 17:26  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_Multiple_Choice_Field.php: Remove two lines of code
	that didn't need to be there.

2007-01-07 11:39  mike

	* CC_Fields/CC_ISO_Country_Field.php: Finished (some were missing)
	the signature of the constructor so the args of the parent object
	will be used.

2007-01-06 13:39  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_Expiry_Date_Field.php: Only set startYear if it's
	not already specified.

2006-11-06 15:28  mike

	delimiter.

2006-11-02 10:38  mike

	in the getField function of this object, boo-yaa!

2006-11-02 10:36  mike

2006-11-02 10:35  mike

	* CC_RelationshipManager.php: one last try...

2006-11-02 10:32  mike

	of files being uploaded.

2006-10-18 17:53  patrick

	* pngfix.js: Set the width and the height of the fixed image to
	that of the original.

2006-10-17 10:56  patrick

	* CC_Index.php: Add a hook for applications like events.confreg.com
	to require additional folders/files...
	
	If the function _n2o_init() exists, N2O will load it before
	starting the application.

2006-09-29 17:10  patrick

	* CC_Application.php: Fixed a JavaScript error in getFormClose()
	that seems to only be a problem in Firecrap.

2006-09-28 13:25  jamie

	* CC_Handlers/CC_Download_XLS_Summary_Handler.php: Removed double
	quotes from Excel download filename.

2006-07-23 23:11  jamie

	* CC_Components/CC_Query_Additions/CC_Date_Query_Addition.php:
	Added Date Query Addition.

2006-07-12 12:01  mike

	* CC_Index.php: Parse error... crap!

2006-07-12 12:00  mike

	* CC_Index.php: Require once variable defined folders to decrease
	memory usage, boo-yaa!

2006-05-29 12:42  patrick

	* CC_Summary_Filters/CC_Percentage_Filter.php: Remove some debug
	output.

2006-05-24 16:23  patrick

	* CC_Database.php: Added a stack trace to the email.

2006-05-18 17:28  jamie

	* CC_Handlers/CC_Delete_Ordered_Record_Handler.php,
	CC_Summaries/CC_Ordered_Summary.php,
	CC_Windows/CC_Delete_Ordered_Confirm_Window.php: Fixed the ordered
	summary so it works.

2006-05-18 11:08  patrick

	* CC_Summary_Filters/CC_Percentage_Filter.php: Don't display
	bar-end.png if percent == 0.

2006-05-18 09:28  patrick

	* cc_styles.css, CC_Images/bar-100.gif, CC_Images/bar-empty.gif,
	CC_Images/bar-end.png, CC_Images/bar-orange.gif,
	CC_Images/bar-red.gif, CC_Images/bar-yellow.gif,
	CC_Summary_Filters/CC_Percentage_Filter.php: A long-overdue update
	to the percentage thingy...

2006-05-17 17:23  patrick

	* CC_Summary_Filters/CC_Month_Filter.php: Waste of space/memory...

2006-05-12 16:37  mike

	* CC_Summary_Filters/CC_Percentage_Filter.php: Round to avoid...
	66.666666666667%

2006-05-09 16:36  patrick

	* CC_Database.php: Get rid of instance variables we don't need to
	store, and don't try to close the database connection if it's an
	error!

2006-05-09 16:24  patrick

	* CC_Database.php: Don't close the database connection until the
	object is serialized.

2006-02-17 18:15  patrick

	* CC_Summary.php, CC_Handlers/CC_Download_ZIP_Summary_Handler.php,
	CC_Images/cc_summary.excel-tab.png: A few fixes for
	text-downloading.

2005-12-31 10:31  jamie

	* CC_Summary.php: Problem: GetRawSummary was indexing the
	LAST_MODIFIED column by name, instead of by number.
	
	Solution: Index it by number, so it can be display in the XLS
	Spreadsheet Writer.

2005-12-09 11:57  jamie

	* CC_Fields/CC_Multiple_SelectList_Field.php: More fixes to ensure
	that the array is maintained as the value.

2005-12-09 11:04  jamie

	* CC_Graph.php: Commited this file be-a-steak.

2005-12-08 19:57  jamie

	* CC_Fields/CC_Multiple_SelectList_Field.php: SetValue overriden to
	ensure that the value is always an array.

2005-12-08 19:56  jamie

	* CC_Graph.php, CC_Pie_Chart.php,
	CC_Components/CC_MultipleKey_Record.php: Problem:
	
	Solution:

2005-12-06 18:48  jamie

	* CC_Fields/CC_Multiple_SelectList_Field.php: Update the value if
	no selections are made. Previously it was retaining the old values.

2005-12-06 18:32  jamie

	* CC_Fields/CC_Multiple_SelectList_Field.php: Make sure that value
	is maintained as an array.

2005-11-28 19:32  patrick

	* CC_Application.php: Make sure document.getElementsByTagName
	exists (if it doesn't, we're dealing with a browser that isn't
	DOM1-compliant.

2005-11-28 19:26  patrick

	* CC_Application.php: No more CC_Form reference in Javascript.

2005-11-28 17:47  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_RadioButton.php: Fix the javascript.

2005-11-28 17:15  patrick

	* CC_Fields/: CC_AutoSubmit_Select_Field.php,
	CC_Checkbox_Field.php, CC_RadioButton.php: Javascript fixes to not
	be dependent on a form called "CC_Form".

2005-11-16 12:13  jamie

	* CC_Fields/CC_ProvinceState_Field.php (PHP5): Targ it. Starts
	Farst.

2005-11-16 12:08  jamie

	* CC_Record.php, CC_Fields/CC_ProvinceState_Field.php (PHP5): PHP%
	Chanrnges for GOAL!

2005-10-06 15:42  patrick

	* cc_styles.css, CC_Components/CC_Folder_Component.php,
	CC_Components/CC_Image_Folder_Component.php, CC_Images/folder.png:
	Clean up these components a bit to use styles instead of the
	archaic HTML way.

2005-10-04 16:10  patrick

	* .htaccess, pngfix.js: Added my pngfix.js to N2O so that anything
	can easily include it, as N2O uses some nice 24-bit PNGs in
	CC_Summary and other places...
	
	Just throw the following line into your header:
	
	<!--[if IE]><script language="JavaScript" type="text/javascript"
	src="/N2O/pngfix.js"></script><![endif]-->
	
	This way, you don't have to add the special style="" thing to every
	PNG image.

2005-09-29 14:54  patrick

	* CC_Summary_Filters/CC_Percentage_Filter.php: One more minor fix
	with 0%.

2005-09-29 14:31  patrick

	* CC_Summary_Filters/CC_Percentage_Filter.php: Fix for 100%.

2005-09-29 14:25  patrick

	* CC_Summary_Filters/CC_Percentage_Filter.php: Simplified filter,
	and added border="0" to the img tags.

2005-09-29 14:14  patrick

	* CC_Components/CC_Summary_Search_Component.php: Make any
	CC_SelectList_Query_Addition's automatically click on the search
	button when their value is changed.

2005-09-26 12:44  patrick

	* CC_Window.php: Simplified getButton() slightly.

2005-09-26 12:43  patrick

	* CC_Record.php: Fixed constructor to use doGetRow() instead of
	doSelect() plus cc_fetch_row(), and also removed duplicate call to
	setRecord() on the fields in initialize().

2005-09-26 12:41  patrick

	* CC_Button.php: If a button is not clickable, don't allow the
	click() method to be called.

2005-09-26 12:40  patrick

	* cc_styles.css: width: 100% on ccSummaryControl style.

2005-09-26 12:39  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_Text_Field.php: Updated documentation.

2005-09-24 17:21  jamie

	* CC_Fields/CC_ProvinceState_Field.php: Typo. narArray -> naArray.

2005-09-20 17:52  patrick

	* CC_Summary.php: Removed a crude message that got displayed to IE
	users when you clicked on a row.

2005-09-20 11:32  patrick

	* CC_Summary.php: Don't use getLabel() in getSummaryControlRow()
	for the Page: thing because the right side (Records Per Page)
	doesn't. The reason being that you should be able to easily set the
	style on both sets of text without other styles
	(ccNotRequiredField) getting in the way.

2005-09-14 16:53  patrick

	* CC_Handlers/CC_Summary_PreviousNext_Handler.php: Forgot to fix
	the constructor name.

2005-09-14 16:43  patrick

	* CC_Handlers/: CC_Summary_Next_Handler.php,
	CC_Summary_PreviousNext_Handler.php,
	CC_Summary_Previous_Handler.php: Rather than have two
	virtually-identical handlers, lets just have one flexible one.

2005-09-14 16:41  patrick

	* CC_Summary.php: Change the summary control table to not set an
	explicit width or colour; instead, the respective style in
	cc_styles.css is used, which can more easily be overridden.
	
	Also update the next and previous buttons to use a unified handler.

2005-09-14 16:35  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_AutoSubmit_Select_Field.php: Fixed a bug in
	handleUpdateFromRequest() that was causing the associated button to
	be click()ed when it was hidden, without checking for a change in
	value. The biggest effect this bug had was in rendering the
	CC_Summary last and next page buttons to battle with the jump to
	page lists.

2005-09-14 16:07  patrick

	* cc_styles.css: Get regular text in ccSummaryHeadings rows, too.

2005-09-14 16:04  patrick

	* .htaccess: Fixed to allow pngfix.htc and cc_styles.css.

2005-09-13 14:02  patrick

	* cc_styles.css: The background-color style takes "transparent"
	instead of "none".

2005-09-13 13:06  patrick

	* .htaccess, cc_styles.css, CC_Buttons/CC_Sort_Button.php,
	CC_Components/CC_Summary_Search_Component.php, CC_Images/add.png,
	CC_Images/cc_summary.delete.png, CC_Images/cc_summary.edit.png,
	CC_Images/cc_summary.view.png, CC_Images/clear.png,
	CC_Images/down_arrow.png, CC_Images/go.png,
	CC_Images/next.inactive.png, CC_Images/next.png,
	CC_Images/previous.inactive.png, CC_Images/previous.png,
	CC_Images/refresh.png, CC_Images/search.png,
	CC_Images/up_arrow.png: Updated the look of things slightly.
	
	Also, CC_Summary now uses styles for defining the row colours
	rather than the now deprecated $ccRecordEvenRowColour and
	$ccRecordOddRowColour. See the "table.ccSummary tr.even" and
	"table.ccSummary tr.odd" styles in cc_styles.css. You can override
	this more easily now in your site stylesheet, and you can also do
	it on a per-CC_Summary basis by giving the summary a DOM ID
	($ccSummary->setId('foo')), and then setting a style for #foo
	tr.even, #foo tr.odd.

2005-09-13 13:00  patrick

	* CC_Database.php: Output an error to the logs if we couldn't
	connect to the DB.

2005-09-13 12:58  patrick

	* CC_Summary.php: Updated setIdColumn() to also update the
	sortByColumn, which defaults to "ID". Thanks to James Nedila of
	Fatport for pointing this out.

2005-07-26 11:57  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_ISO_Country_Field.php: Removed "South Georgia and
	the South Sandwich Islands" since it has no inhabitants
	(http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/sx.html), and
	also shortened the Koreas to their more commonly used names of
	"North" and "South" and "Lao People's Democratic Republic" to
	"Laos".

2005-07-25 14:21  patrick

	* CC_Window.php: getErrorMessage() was placing an opening "<p>" tag
	after the error message which screws up and invalidates HTML. The
	removal of this may have some adverse effects initially, but it
	will all be correctable with styles.

2005-07-25 13:58  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_SelectList_Field.php: Deprecated setVisibleValue()
	-- added setDisplayValue() to match getDisplayValue().

2005-07-19 18:04  patrick

	* CC_Summary.php, cc_styles.css, CC_Buttons/CC_Sort_Button.php:
	Fixed the styles for ccSummaryHeadings, and removed the redundant
	style stuff in the <td>'s and in the CC_Sort_Button.

2005-07-15 12:47  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_SelectList_Field.php: Improve the $isArray setting
	in getSelectedIndex() to reduce erroneous warnings.

2005-07-15 12:43  patrick

	* CC_Components/CC_Summary_Search_Component.php,
	CC_Fields/CC_Safari_Search_Field.php: When Safari is detected, use
	the Safari search field. It's *so* cool!!

2005-07-15 12:27  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_Time_Field.php: Fix getInstance() so that it honours
	the value no matter what it is.

2005-07-14 17:14  jamie

	* CC_Fields/CC_RadioButton_Field.php: GetInstance sets index to 0
	by default.

2005-07-13 12:10  jamie

	* CC_Utilities.php: Problem: There was already a $mode variable.
	
	Solution: Renamed the file mode to $fileMode :).

2005-07-13 11:59  jamie

	* CC_Utilities.php: Problem: writeFile only used the 'w' mode.
	
	Solution: Added support for any writing mode. Default is 'w'.

2005-07-13 10:47  patrick

	* CC_Index.php: When we update the expiry date/time for the session
	cookie, we also now include the configured session path and domain.

2005-07-12 18:59  patrick

	* CC_Index.php: A fix to update the session expiration on every
	request.
	
	This was accomplished by calling session_cache_expire() and when
	the session already exists, setcookie(session_name(), session_id(),
	time() + $session_expiry).

2005-07-12 18:34  jamie

	* CC_Fields/: CC_Foreign_Key_Field.php, CC_SelectList_Field.php:
	Problem: getViewHTML was not always taking account the unselected
	value.
	
	Solution: getViewHTML is now taking into account the unselected
	value and returning nothing if there is no selected value.

2005-07-08 15:38  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_Time_Field.php: Fixed handleUpdateFromRequest() to
	work properly. The test to see if the hour field was in the request
	had a typo.

2005-07-07 15:09  jamie

	* CC_Handlers/CC_Delete_Record_Handler.php: Added support for
	passing in a custom deleteAction.

2005-07-07 15:07  jamie

	* CC_RelationshipManager.php: Problem: - Select - was being used as
	the default unselected value bypassing the passed-in value.
	
	Solution: removed the hard-coded value and replaced it with the
	parameter from the constructor.

2005-07-07 14:58  jamie

	* CC_Fields/: CC_PostalCode_Field.php, CC_PostalZipCode_Field.php,
	CC_ZipCode_Field.php: Added support for country-based validation
	with the setCountryField method.

2005-07-05 15:23  mike

	* CC_Fields/CC_Dollar_Field.php: Added an id="" to the html tag so
	this field will work with field->setId('asdf');

2005-07-05 12:17  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_Foreign_Key_Field.php: Removed the unnecessary
	reference to the current window.

2005-06-30 14:20  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_SelectList_Field.php: Added documentation of field
	manager args.

2005-06-30 14:20  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_Foreign_Key_Field.php: Add support for
	unselectedValue= in the field manager. Also added documentation of
	field manager args.

2005-06-30 11:55  patrick

	* CC_Summary.php: When we display the note about a missing ID
	column in the query, also include the name of the summary so it's
	easier to locate.

2005-06-29 13:14  mike

	* CC_Components/CC_MultipleKey_Record.php: Fixed buildInsertQuery
	to take into account the record keys (and not display them twice).

2005-06-27 15:26  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_Password_Field.php: Forgot some ()'s.

2005-06-27 15:18  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_Password_Field.php: Override setValue() to be smart
	enough to not erase the password if the field has a value, an empty
	value was passed in, and showPassword is false.

2005-06-26 17:01  patrick

	* CC_ErrorManager.php,
	CC_Components/CC_Summary_Search_Component.php: Rolling back due to
	accidental checkin. Whoops!

2005-06-26 16:55  patrick

	* CC_ErrorManager.php, CC_Field.php, ChangeLog,
	CC_Buttons/CC_Text_Button.php,
	CC_Components/CC_Summary_Search_Component.php,
	CC_Windows/CC_Add_Record_Window.php,
	CC_Windows/CC_Edit_Record_Window.php,
	CC_Windows/CC_View_Record_Window.php: [no log message]

2005-06-26 16:50  patrick

	* CC_Summary.php: Phase out CC_Summary->columnHeaderColour, which
	was set from the CC_Config variable, $ccTitleBarColour. You can
	just set the background-color style for "tr.ccSummaryHeadings td".
	From N2O/cc_styles.css:
	
	/* Style for CC_Summary column headings row. */
	tr.ccSummaryHeadings td {	font-weight: bold;	color:
	#ffffff;	 background-color: #666666; }

2005-06-26 16:47  patrick

	* CC_Config.php: Get rid of $application_name, $version_number, and
	the never implemented $show_action_in_url. Also, added the
	$require_admin variable to include additional classes like
	CC_Summary.

2005-06-26 16:45  patrick

	* CC_Handlers/CC_Download_XLS_Summary_Handler.php: Quote the
	filename so it works better for WinIE.

2005-06-26 16:42  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_Expiry_Date_Field.php: Make the default start year
	be 2005. This should probably just get the current year
	dynamically.

2005-06-26 16:41  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_Date_Field.php: Make the default start year be 2000.

2005-06-26 16:40  patrick

	* cc_styles.css: CC_Summary column headings default to a #666666
	background colour.

2005-06-26 16:39  patrick

	* CC_Window.php: Minor formatting diffs...

2005-06-22 15:15  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_Checkbox_Field.php: Removed getLiarValue() -- it was
	exactly the same as getYesNoValue(), and it was too weird to keep.
	getLiarValue? Weird.

2005-06-15 12:55  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_AutoSubmit_Select_Field.php: Fixd a bug in
	getEditHTML() that was not calling the correct javascript when the
	go button was visible and the select list was changed.

2005-06-15 12:36  patrick

	* CC_Window.php: Typo in variable name in
	updateFieldFromDatabase().

2005-06-15 12:34  patrick

	* CC_Components/CC_MultipleKey_Record.php: It's best if we only
	check in code that compiles!!

2005-06-15 12:04  patrick

	* CC_Field.php: Removed a debug line in getInstance().

2005-06-14 18:00  mike

	* CC_Application.php, CC_Components/CC_MultipleKey_Record.php:
	Added clearObject($name) method to CC_Application.
	
	Fixed error message for CC_MultipleKey_Record to take into account
	the multiple keys!

2005-06-14 17:51  jamie

	* CC_Fields/CC_SelectList_Field.php: Problem: Was returning the
	options array after unsetting it in getViewHTML.
	
	Solution: Assigned it to a variable, then unset it.

2005-06-08 13:50  mike

	* CC_Fields/CC_Checkbox_Field.php: Problem: when field is disabled
	we needed to keep its value.
	
	Solution: checked if disabled and if so don't update the value.

2005-06-07 13:29  patrick

	* cc_styles.css, CC_Fields/CC_File_Upload_Field.php,
	CC_Fields/CC_Multiple_File_Upload_Field.php: Making this field
	work!
	
	Instead of removing the field from the uploadFieldArray when it is
	deleted, we're just calling resetField() on it.

2005-06-07 13:27  patrick

	* CC_Index.php: Removed a redundant check for $newSession.

2005-06-06 16:10  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_Percentage_Field.php: The width of the percentage
	bar was off by 4 pixels.

2005-06-06 11:48  patrick

	* bin/encodeN2O.sh: Don't delete CC_Database and CC_Utilities after
	merging so that they can be included in scripts.

2005-06-02 19:47  patrick

	* CC_Summary.php, CC_Handlers/CC_Summary_Num_Rows_Handler.php,
	CC_Summaries/CC_Safe_Summary.php: Fixed the safe summary to support
	the not updating if there was already an update in the last two
	seconds.

2005-06-02 19:43  patrick

	* CC_Window.php: Removed two old, unused lines of code from
	updateFieldFromPage().

2005-06-02 19:43  patrick

	* CC_Button.php: Removed the contents of setFieldsToUpdate()
	because it's deprecated and no one uses it.

2005-06-02 18:00  patrick

	* CC_Record.php: Retired saveAndDuplicateRecord() -- it's never
	used, and not even that useful...

2005-06-02 17:58  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_ProvinceState_Field.php: Fixed the province/state
	first thingy.

2005-06-02 17:51  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_ProvinceState_Field.php: Forgot to add support for
	the abbreviated= argument. Also added documentation for the
	possible arguments with CC_FieldManager's addField().

2005-06-02 17:18  patrick

	* CC_Application.php: Added some nifty Javascript that fixes all of
	the stupid browsers (pretty much all of them!) when it comes to
	pressing enter in a field. Browsers *used* to just submit the form,
	but now they all seem to also send along the name of the first
	found button on the form. >:*(
	
	The new Javascript assigns an event handler to all of the input
	fields that detect when the enter key is pressed. When it is
	pressed, it looks for a default button on the page, and clicks it.
	If no default button was found ($window->setDefaultButton()), it
	will just act as it normally would.

2005-06-02 17:11  jamie

	* CC_Fields/: CC_IntegerNumber_Field.php, CC_Password_Field.php:
	Problem: Missing some args in getInstance for CC_PassworidField
	(saveAsPlainText) and CC_IntegerNumber_Field(min and max values).)
	
	Solution: Added these old school.

2005-06-02 17:08  patrick

	* CC_Window.php: Register the field in registerField() using an
	index of $field->getRequestArrayName() instead of
	$field->getName().

2005-06-02 14:01  patrick

	* CC_Fields/: CC_Multiple_SelectList_Field.php,
	CC_SelectList_Field.php: Numerous optimizations and simplifications
	of iterative methods.
	
	These fields both were both using array_keys() with the options
	array, but the options array is always numerically indexed, so this
	was unnecessary.

2005-06-02 13:36  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_Percentage_Field.php: To avoid warning messages, we
	now use isset() instead of array_key_exists() when checking the
	request array in handleUpdateFromRequest().

2005-06-02 13:34  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_Foreign_Key_Field.php: Defer constructing the add
	button and registering the handler from the constructor to the
	register() callback method.

2005-06-02 13:30  patrick

	* CC_Summary_Filters/CC_Percentage_Filter.php: You can now specify
	the width of the filter in the constructor should you want
	something other than the default.

2005-06-01 20:43  patrick

	* CC_Field.php, CC_Fields/CC_Text_Field.php: Updated documentation
	for reference for CC_FieldManager's addField() method.

2005-06-01 20:38  patrick

	* CC_FieldManager.php: Fix documentation for addField().

2005-06-01 20:32  patrick

	* CC_Record.php: You can now add a value=the_value as the arguments
	in the field manager's addField() method for all fields.

2005-06-01 20:31  jamie

	* CC_Fields/CC_Text_Field.php: Awww pooo!

2005-06-01 20:28  jamie

	* CC_Fields/CC_Text_Field.php: Added the value back. Thanks
	Patrick!

2005-06-01 12:28  patrick

	* CC_Component.php: Typo.

2005-06-01 10:14  patrick

	* CC_Component.php: Display a warning if you construct a component
	using a period "." because it will cause you many problems.

2005-05-30 17:58  patrick

	* CC_Buttons/CC_Image_Button.php: Improve click() to access the
	$_REQUEST array just once, and to check that the keys exist before
	getting them so that we don't clutter the error logs with stupid
	warnings.

2005-05-30 16:53  patrick

	* CC_Button.php: Renamed getClickable() to the more appropriate
	isClickable().

2005-05-30 14:58  patrick

	* CC_Buttons/CC_Image_Button.php: Added setDisabledImagePath() so
	that you can have it use a different image when the button is
	disabled with setClickable(false).

2005-05-27 17:15  patrick

	* CC_Record.php: IMPORTANT CHANGE!
	
	If an error happens in the constructor (ie. bad query or
	non-existent ID), you will get a PEAR_Error object instead of a
	CC_Record.
	
	Example:
	
	$record = &new CC_Record('NAME,EMAIL,PASSWORD', 'MY_TABLE', true,
	42);
	
	if (PEAR::isError($record)) {	echo "No record existed with the
	passed ID.";   $application->unregisterCurrentWindow();       
	exit(); }

2005-05-27 16:59  patrick

	* CC_Images/percentBar.gif: It was time for an updated look.

2005-05-26 17:27  jamie

	* CC_Application.php: Problem: There was no way to reset all fields
	and stuff.
	
	Solution: The reset() function saves the day.

2005-05-26 16:53  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_Percentage_Field.php: The buttons contained in this
	field needed setValidateOnClick(false) called on them, as you
	should be able to use them even if other fields on the page don't
	pass validation.

2005-05-26 16:51  patrick

	* CC_Button.php, CC_Window.php: Fixed a somewhat obscure bug that
	prevented the window from passing validation if you had two records
	in a window, both with a field using the same key, and a button
	that had setRecordsToValidate() called using the first record, and
	the second record's field with the same name was required and was
	not entered.

2005-05-26 13:04  patrick

	* CC_Handlers/: CC_Unregister_Window_Handler.php,
	CC_Unregister_Window_Handlr.php: Renamed file to match the class
	name. This must be left over from when we were on Mac OS 9!!

2005-05-25 18:36  jamie

	* CC_Fields/: CC_Password_Field.php, CC_RadioButton.php: Problem:
	Password field had no way to set minLength and alphaNumeric in the
	Application. RadioButton field wasn't selecting via the label.
	
	Solution: Fixed both these problems.

2005-05-24 16:51  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_Percentage_Field.php: Resolved a reference issue
	that was causing the 100% button not to function.

2005-05-24 16:22  patrick

	* CC_Summary.php: Another minor typo in update().

2005-05-24 16:14  patrick

	* CC_Handlers/CC_Update_Record_Handler.php: Stupid typos.

2005-05-24 16:11  patrick

	* CC_Handlers/: CC_Insert_Record_Handler.php,
	CC_Update_Record_Handler.php: Fixed a member call on non-object
	error that would occur if there was an error in the insert or
	update query (which would be caused if you specified a non-existent
	column or table in your record).

2005-05-24 15:52  patrick

	* CC_Summary.php: Typo.

2005-05-24 15:49  patrick

	* CC_Summary.php: Minor simplification in update() using
	db->doGetOne() instead of the longer way.

2005-05-24 15:07  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_Date_Field.php: Fixed a bug where setMonthValue()
	and setDateValue() were not working if the number passed in was
	0-padded.

2005-05-19 16:59  patrick

	* CC_Components/CC_MultipleKey_Record.php: Define $size in the
	right place.

2005-05-19 16:54  patrick

	* CC_User.php: Changed [g|s]etUserName() to [g|s]etUsername()
	because they were bugging me.

2005-05-19 16:53  patrick

	* CC_Record.php, CC_Components/CC_MultipleKey_Record.php: Fixed the
	multiple key record to do things the new way.

2005-05-19 16:44  patrick

	* CC_Record.php: Use the field name for the label when there's no
	field data.

2005-05-19 16:37  patrick

	* CC_Record.php: Handle things gracefully if no field data exists
	for a field by constructing a cc_text_field with a generic label.

2005-05-11 10:54  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_SelectList_Field.php: Fixed a bug in getViewHTML()
	where if you had an unselectedValue set, and the field had no value
	set (eg. getSelectedIndex() == 0), a warning would be produced in
	the logs because we were trying to look up an index of -1 in the
	options array.

2005-05-11 10:42  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_Date_Field.php: Fixed a new bug in setValue() that I
	introduced when I optimized the parsing of the passed in value.

2005-05-10 22:30  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_Credit_Card_Field.php: Simplified getEditHTML(),
	fixed it to support the tabindex.

2005-05-10 17:39  patrick

	* bin/: encodeN2O.sh, switchN2O.sh: Updated scripts for you guyz.
	
	You'll need the new encodeN2O.sh to handle the new
	_RequireOnceAdminFiles.php file, and the switchN2O.sh is superior
	than before in that it just uses a symbolic link when you're using
	your dev tree.

2005-05-10 17:31  patrick

	* CC_Application.php, CC_Component.php, CC_Field.php,
	CC_FieldManager.php, CC_Index.php, CC_Record.php, CC_Utilities.php,
	CC_Window.php, ChangeLog, _RequireOnceAdminFiles.php,

	CC_Fields/CC_Timestamp_Field.php, CC_Fields/CC_Username_Field.php,
	CC_Handlers/CC_Cancel_Cleanup_Handler.php: The initial check-in of
	a rather large overhaul to N2O.
	
	Changes include:
	
	1. Fields now construct themselves using a static method (see
	CC_Field::getInstance()). Next step will be to add documentation to
	all of the fields to show what arguments they accept when
	constructed by a CC_Record (eg. size=, maxlength=, etc). This
	completely eliminates createFieldObject() and
	createOtherFieldObject(). As such, custom record classes are no
	longer necessary, and are in fact basically useless.
	
	Because of this change, it is now necessary that the classnames of
	the fields you add to the field manager (addField()) actually
	exist. We previously had a few shortcuts like CC_FK_Field for
	CC_Foreign_Key_Field, and various permutations of the
	province/state field. In the case of the latter, you must define it
	as "CC_ProvinceState_Field", and then you can use the "type"
	argument to define what sort of field it is: type=state,
	type=province, type=stateprovince.
	
	2. Fields handle the updating of themselves using
	handleUpdateFromRequest(). Custom fields that need special updating
	will need to override this method.
	
	3. Before, fields that were in a record were not registered with
	the window. Instead, CC_Window did a loop on stray fields, and then
	a loop on each record with an inner loop on each field in the
	record. Now, records register their fields with the window, and the
	window does only one loop. This has the added benefit that the
	register() call-back method in the fields is now properly called,
	fixing a bug where an auto-submit select list field would not
	function properly if constructed by a record.
	
	4. CC_Window has a new method: setUnregisterOnLeave(). If called,
	the window will automatically be unregistered by the application
	when the application switches away from said window. By setting
	this on your windows, you can reduce the overall memory footprint
	of the session.
	
	5. There is a new config option: $require_admin. When set to false
	(defaults to true), the application will not load admin classes
	such as CC_Summary (and every class/handler that CC_Summary uses),
	CC_Graph, CC_Pie_Chart, CC_Zip_File, CC_Image_Utilities, and all of
	the classes in the CC_Components folder. Most front-end
	applications do not need these classes, and including them in the
	session just adds unnecessary overhead.
	
	6. A bunch of useless fields have been removed including
	CC_Date_Added_Field.php, CC_Hidden_Field, CC_Hidden_Number_Field,
	CC_Related_Table_Field, and CC_Username_Field.
	
	Please test away, as I don't think it's quite ready for a STABLE
	declaration.

2005-05-02 11:56  patrick

	* CC_Record.php: Fixed a bug introduced by a previous commit
	whereby an older variable was still being referenced in the
	constructor.

2005-04-27 19:28  patrick

	* CC_FieldManager.php, CC_Record.php, CC_Window.php: Consolidated a
	bunch of the code in CC_Record::createFieldObject() so that more
	fields take advantage of the field manager arguments like size=,
	maxlength=, etc.

2005-04-27 19:27  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_Credit_Card_Field.php: Updated the constructor so
	you can set the maxlength.

2005-04-27 19:26  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_ProvinceState_Field.php: Moved the unselected value
	setting into the field rather than in CC_Record.

2005-04-27 19:22  patrick

	* CC_Summary_Filters/CC_Relative_Timestamp_Filter.php: file
	CC_Relative_Timestamp_Filter.php was initially added on branch
	PHP5.

2005-04-27 19:21  patrick

	5...

2005-04-23 16:07  patrick

	* CC_Utilities.php: Improve strSlide13 a great deal to make the
	"encoded" strings a lot less easy to recognize what is happening.
	Before, the string "4111111111111111" would encode to
	"5222222222222222". Now, the same string encodes to
	"jccccccccccccccc". An average credit card number like
	"5191230074364956" used to encode to "4808769925635043", and now
	encodes to "EcZcUfQQijfSjZES".
	
	One caveat of changing this is we will likely need to clear all
	sessions the next time N2O is deployed because the active database
	DSNs and credit card numbers previously encoded with the old
	version of strSlide13() will not slide to their original state
	properly.
	
	To create the new sliding string, I wrote a little algorithm:
	
	<?php
	
	$source =
	'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1234567890!@#$%^&*()_+:/?.;~
	='; $array1 = array();
	
	if (strlen($source) % 2 != 0) { 	echo "Source string must be
	an even number of characters. (Length: " . strlen($source) . ")\n";
		exit(); }
	
	// Create an array of our source string for ($i = 0; $i <
	strlen($source); $i++) {      $array1[] = substr($source, $i, 1); }
	
	// Make a copy of the array that will be used for the slide $array2
	= $array1;
	
	// Create a tracker array to keep track of which positions we've
	used $tracker = array(); $max = sizeof($array1);
	
	for ($i = 0; $i < $max; $i++) { 	$tracker[] = true; }
	
	// Do the swapping work...  for ($i = 0; $i < ($max / 2); $i++) {  
	    do	    {		    $swap = rand($max / 2, $max - 1);
	
			if ($tracker[$swap] && $swap != $i)
			{
				break;
			}
		}
		while (true);
	
		$tracker[$i] = false;
		$tracker[$swap] = false;
	
		$tmp1 = $array2[$i];
		$tmp2 = $array2[$swap];
	
		$array2[$i] = $tmp2;
		$array2[$swap] = $tmp1;
	}
	
	// Output the source echo "$source\n";
	
	// Output the slid source for ($i = 0; $i < $max; $i++) {      
	echo $array2[$i]; }
	
	echo "\n";
	
	?>

2005-04-21 21:31  patrick

	* CC_Utilities.php: Removed conditional declaration of is_a() since
	we always use PHP 4.2+.

2005-04-01 13:00  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_Date_Field.php: Removed the monthsArray from the
	instance variables because it's only needed once.

2005-04-01 12:59  patrick

	* CC_Summary.php: Renamed a variable in setDownloadAllQuery() so
	it's more understandable.

2005-03-31 13:20  patrick

	* CC_Handlers/CC_Summary_Search_Handler.php: Get the download query
	using getDownloadAllQuery() rather than pulling it from the private
	variable which may or may not be set.

2005-03-30 15:51  jamie

	* CC_Handlers/CC_Summary_Search_Handler.php: Added support for
	ORing delimiter separated values in the text search field.

2005-03-30 15:50  jamie

	* CC_Components/CC_Summary_Search_Component.php: Added orDelimiter
	for delimiter-separated OR support.

2005-03-29 19:18  jamie

	* CC_Fields/CC_DateTime_Field.php: Changed format string BACK for
	BACKwards compatibility.

2005-03-29 19:14  jamie

	* CC_Fields/CC_DateTime_Field.php: Fixed the format string for
	hours and minutes.

2005-03-29 18:32  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_Date_Field.php: Remove getMySQLValue(). Instead, use
	getValue(), passing it a format string: getValue('%04u-%02u-%02u
	00:00:00');

2005-03-29 18:31  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_DateTime_Field.php: Removed getMySQLValue().
	Instead, getValue() takes an option $format string. To do what
	getMySQLValue() did, call getValue('%u-%0u-%0u %0u:%0u:00'), or
	define a constant in your application:
	
	define('MYSQL_DATETIME', '%u-%0u-%0u %0u:%0u:00');
	
	$field->getValue(MYSQL_DATETIME);

2005-03-29 17:59  jamie

	* CC_Fields/: CC_DateTime_Field.php, CC_Date_Field.php: Added
	getMySQLValue to return a MySQL friendly date.

2005-03-28 20:12  jamie

	* CC_Summary.php: In getDownloadAllQuery, added an option to
	optionally return the sorted query. Defaults to false.

2005-03-27 13:57  patrick

	* clear_eaccelerator.php: First argument is now the full URL to
	eaccelerator.php rather than just the host.

2005-03-24 18:08  patrick

	* .htaccess, clear_eaccelerator.php, eaccelerator.php: Added
	scripts to clear eaccelerator's cache for when we re-deploy N2O. No
	more restarting stupid Apache!!

2005-03-24 18:07  patrick

	* ChangeLog, bin/cvs2cl.pl: ChangeLog updates.

2005-03-24 17:44  jamie

	* CC_Summary.php: A check in CC_Summary if the cookie value for the
	'SORT BY' column exists in the query.

2005-03-23 21:18  jamie

	* CC_Fields/CC_Multiple_File_Upload_Field.php: Removed debug code.

2005-03-23 21:11  jamie

	* CC_Fields/CC_Multiple_File_Upload_Field.php: Fixed this field to
	work better.

2005-03-20 17:55  patrick

	* CC_Index.php: No longer look for the ?err in the request, no
	longer define CURRENT_VERSION, and no longer output a logout button
	if DEBUG is 1.

2005-03-20 11:15  patrick

	* classes.conf.php: We don't need this anymore.

2005-03-16 15:38  patrick

	* CC_Graph.php: Create an indexed .png instead of true-colour to
	fix god damn IE + Norton Personal Firecrap. Hope it doesn't break
	anything!

2005-03-16 13:58  patrick

	* CC_Summary_Filters/CC_Id_Link_Filter.php: Fixed to work without
	cookies.

2005-03-16 12:43  patrick

	* CC_Application.php, CC_Buttons/CC_AnchorImage_Button.php,
	CC_Buttons/CC_Sort_Button.php, CC_Buttons/CC_Text_Button.php: A few
	fixes to get things working properly when cookies are disabled.

2005-03-14 15:18  patrick

	* CC_Graph.php: Removed accidental checkin.

2005-03-14 10:36  jamie

	* CC_Summary_Filters/CC_Text_Shortening_Filter.php: Dealt with
	doube-quotes properly.

2005-03-11 19:53  jamie

	* CC_Summary_Filters/CC_Text_Shortening_Filter.php: Dumb ASS FUCK.

2005-03-11 19:21  jamie

	* CC_Summary_Filters/CC_Text_Shortening_Filter.php: Allow multiple
	lines in Javascript alert.

2005-03-11 18:40  jamie

	* CC_Summary_Filters/CC_Text_Shortening_Filter.php: Escape single
	quotes so it doesn't krunk things up.

2005-03-11 11:58  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_Time_Field.php: getValue() was padding the hour
	value with two extra 0's...

2005-03-11 11:34  mike

	* CC_Summary_Filters/CC_Text_Shortening_Filter.php: removed extra
	option that did nothing! :O

2005-03-11 11:34  mike

	* CC_Summary_Filters/CC_Text_Shortening_Filter.php: Added option to
	popup (alert) full text for the text shortening dingle.

2005-03-11 10:38  mike

	* CC_Summary_Filters/CC_DateTime_Filter.php: Fixed comparison for
	blank date.

2005-03-11 10:27  patrick

	* CC_Summary.php: Make sure all queries use getSortByColumn()
	instead of $this->sortByColumn.

2005-03-11 10:22  patrick

	* CC_Summary.php: Add getSortByColumn() to do the quoting in there.

2005-03-05 23:15  patrick

	* bin/buildExtras.php (PHP5): We won't be needing this anymore...

2005-03-05 23:13  patrick

	* CC_Handlers/: CC_Summary_JumpPage_Handler.php,
	CC_Summary_Jump_To_Page_Handler.php (PHP5): One downside with the
	__autoload() thingy is that class names and file names need to
	match. (This probably isn't such a bad thing for us to do, though.)

2005-03-05 23:13  patrick

	* CC_Handlers/CC_Summary_Jump_To_Page_Handler.php: file
	CC_Summary_Jump_To_Page_Handler.php was initially added on branch
	PHP5.

2005-03-05 23:11  patrick

	CC_Summaries/CC_Ordered_Summary.php,
	CC_Summaries/CC_Safe_Summary.php (PHP5), bin/buildExtras.php: Minor
	changes needed to get things working properly in PHP 5. Yeah baby,
	you heard me -- PHP 5!!
	
	PHP 5 has a neat __autoload() function you can implement so that
	you can have classes be loaded only when they are needed. The PHP5
	branch of N2O supports this!

2005-03-05 16:47  patrick

	* CC_Graph.php: var $barWidth was declared twice!

2005-03-05 16:46  patrick

	* CC_Application.php: var $lastAction was declared twice!

2005-03-02 14:59  patrick

	* cc_styles.css: Add a margin for the ccSummaryDownload style.

2005-02-28 11:19  mike

	* CC_Record.php: Added a delimiter option to radio button lists, so
	we can have commas in the radio button label.

2005-02-27 16:12  patrick

	* CC_Handlers/CC_Download_XLS_Summary_Handler.php: Fixed this
	handler to get the filename from the summary when it doesn't
	already have an explicit filename to use.

2005-02-27 16:11  patrick

	* CC_Summary.php: Moved the construction of the download all
	buttons from getExtraSummaryButtons() into register() where it
	should happen.

2005-02-24 21:38  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_RadioButton_Field.php: Use the === when comparing
	values so that if your radio button happens to have a value of '0',
	it is not confused with false.

2005-02-24 21:30  patrick

	* CC_Record.php: Call setRecord() on the fields at the time the
	record is registered rather than at the time the field is created.
	This is because with the old way, if you called setOptions() on a
	radio button field after it was created by a record, the radio
	buttons did not have the reference to the record.

2005-02-22 18:30  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_RadioButton.php: Added setOnMouseOverAction() and
	setOnMouseOutAction().

2005-02-22 15:29  jamie

	* CC_Fields/CC_Multiple_Choice_Field.php: Added a note to for the
	setAssociatedField method. The main field goes LAST in the
	CC_Record construction.

2005-02-18 12:05  jamie

	* CC_Fields/CC_ProvinceState_Field.php: XX = N/A.

2005-02-17 17:08  patrick

	* CC_Pie_Chart.php: Clean up after drawing a pie chart.

2005-02-14 14:15  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_RadioButton_Field.php: Minor fix in setOptions() to
	get the current value.

2005-02-14 14:10  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_RadioButton_Field.php: Fixed a bug where the options
	array was not being checked for elements that were arrays in
	setOptions(). Also removed the duplicate code in the constructor;
	we now just call setOptions() instead.

2005-02-14 14:07  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_Checkbox_Field.php: The label style should be
	ccLabelError instead of ccError.

2005-02-14 00:58  jamie

	* CC_Fields/CC_ISO_Country_Field.php: Removed Holy See from the
	Vatican.

2005-02-13 23:08  jamie

	* CC_Fields/CC_ISO_Country_Field.php: It DOES exist, doesn't it?

2005-02-13 17:09  patrick

	* CC_Index.php, _RequireOnceFiles.php: The world's not ready for
	_n2o_extras.php yet.

2005-02-13 17:06  jamie

	* CC_Fields/CC_ISO_Country_Field.php: Mispelling FIXED!

2005-01-10 13:14  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_ISO_Country_Field.php: Sort the country by name
	rather than country code.

2004-12-21 12:28  patrick

	* ChangeLog: Updated ChangeLog.

2004-12-21 12:27  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_Generic_Text_Field.php: This is the most useless
	class I've ever seen, and since we never use it, it shouldn't be
	here.

2004-12-21 12:26  patrick

	* CC_Index.php, _RequireOnceFiles.php, classes.conf.php,
	bin/buildExtras.php: Added a feature to N2O where you can now
	specify which classes get loaded for a given application. To do
	this, follow these simple instructions:
	
	1. Navigate into the root folder in which your application resides.
	
	2. Copy the "classes.conf.php" template from your installed N2O
	folder.
	
	3. Edit the copy and choose the classes that fit your needs. For
	example, a front-end application will likely not use CC_Summary and
	all of its supporting classes.
	
	4. Invoke this script from your application's root:    php
	/path/to/N2O/bin/buildExtras.php
	
	5. Run through your application, and make sure there aren't any
	class not found errors. If there are, refine the
	"classes.conf.php", and re-run this script.
	
	6. Any time N2O is upgraded, make sure to re-run this script, as
	classes are actually copied from the N2O tree to a file local to
	your application. You will see warning messages in your web-server
	error log if the version of the classes doesn't match that of the
	installed N2O.
	
	This should speed things up a bit and will reduce overall memory
	usage if you're not using Turck-MMCache. If you are using Turck,
	then your shared memory will be less (providing you don't activate
	all classes.

2004-12-21 12:20  patrick

	* CC_Utilities.php: Removed the debug() function since it's never
	used anymore. trigger_error('message', E_USER_WARNING) or
	error_log() are better alternatives since they log to the apache
	error log.

2004-12-21 12:18  patrick

	* CC_FieldManager.php: Minor formatting fix.

2004-12-21 12:18  patrick

	* CC_Application.php, CC_Config.php: Added a new option to
	CC_Config: $noRelationshipManager. Setting this to true will cause
	CC_Application to not instantiate a relationship manager (if you're
	not using a CC_ForeignKey_Fields, then you really don't need one).

2004-12-21 12:14  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_Dependant_Checkbox_Field.php: Added an $Id: ChangeLog,v 1.16 2010/11/11 04:28:32 patrick Exp $ tag. I
	thought I already did all files!

2004-12-21 12:13  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_Dependant_Checkbox_Field.php: Set the default
	$requiredValue for setAssociatedField() to true, which would be the
	logical value for a checkbox (if it is checked, then you want the
	validate() method to check the associated field's value).

2004-12-20 13:42  patrick

	* CC_Summary_Filters/CC_Dollar_Filter.php: Fixed processValue() to
	make sure there are two decimal places!

2004-12-16 12:30  jamie

	* CC_Summary_Filters/CC_DateTime_Filter.php: Added seconds.

2004-12-15 17:35  jamie

	* CC_Summary.php: getNumRowsPerPage instead of a straight getValue
	on the select list.

2004-12-15 17:33  jamie

	* CC_Summaries/CC_Safe_Summary.php: Called getNumRowsPerPage
	instead of numRowsPerPage->getvalue() so that ALL resolved to the
	total number of records.

2004-12-15 11:35  jamie

	* CC_Fields/CC_Checkbox_Field.php: Typo when checking for readonly.

2004-12-15 11:34  jamie

	* CC_Window.php: Added hasSummary.php to detect if a summary exists
	in the window.

2004-12-10 15:36  patrick

	* CC_Summary_Filters/CC_Dollar_Filter.php: Use number_format()
	instead of sprintf().

2004-12-10 13:44  patrick

	* CC_Window.php: The tabindex on buttons now have an offset of 420
	from the fields. This is so because when you call
	setDefaultButton(), you only want the button to have the lowest
	tabindex of the *buttons*, not fields too.

2004-12-10 13:13  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_Credit_Card_Field.php: Updated setValue() to strip
	out any character that is not a number. Previously, this was just
	done on a temporary value in validate(), but the field should
	really not allow anything but a number to be stored. Also changed
	the default size of the field to 19 characters so that people who
	like to type in spaces between the sets of numbers will be able to.
	This also helps with people who are copying and pasting a number.

2004-12-09 13:33  jamie

	* CC_Fields/CC_RadioButton.php: Don't link the label if it's
	readonly, mofo.

2004-12-09 13:31  jamie

	* CC_Fields/CC_Checkbox_Field.php: Don't link the label if the
	field is not editable.

2004-12-08 15:34  patrick

	* CC_Summary.php, cc_styles.css, png_fix.htc,
	CC_Buttons/CC_AnchorImage_Button.php,
	CC_Images/cc_summary.excel.png: CC_Summary now uses an image for
	the Excel download button.

2004-12-08 03:35  jamie

	* CC_Fields/CC_Time_Field.php: Disable this!

2004-12-08 02:21  jamie

	* CC_Record.php, CC_Fields/CC_DateTime_Field.php,
	CC_Fields/CC_Date_Field.php: Set Disabled is enabled in CC_Record
	and in CC_DateTime_Field and CC_Date_Field.

2004-12-07 22:39  jamie

	* CC_Graph.php: Transparecies for the border only!

2004-12-07 21:39  jamie

	* CC_Pie_Chart.php, CC_Windows/CC_Manage_FK_Table_Window.php: Pie
	anyone?

2004-12-07 21:24  mike

	*
	CC_Components/CC_Query_Additions/CC_SelectList_Query_Addition.php:
	Switched to an AutoSubmit select list... just remember to set the
	default button to the search button in your window... or else!

2004-12-07 19:56  patrick

	* CC_Graph.php: The watermark is now positioned based on the
	dimensions of the watermark image.

2004-12-07 19:42  jamie

	* CC_Graph.php: All the world's a stage!

2004-12-07 19:15  mike

	* CC_Components/CC_Query_Additions/CC_Checkbox_Query_Addition.php:
	Fixed a huge, gigantic, small little bug.

2004-12-07 19:13  patrick

	* CC_Window.php: Eliminated some references...

2004-12-07 19:12  patrick

	* CC_Handlers/CC_InternalRewriteUrl_Handler.php: Made the rewriten
	URL contain the session stuff only if it needs it.

2004-12-07 18:54  mike

	* CC_Handlers/CC_Summary_Search_Handler.php: summary search handler
	is smarter than the dickens now... will update the query AND the
	downloadAll query

2004-12-07 12:05  mike

	* CC_Button.php: Allow setting of the button id in the contructor.

2004-12-07 12:03  patrick

	* CC_Pie_Chart.php: Wrong parameter count when constructing black.

2004-12-07 11:50  patrick

	* CC_Pie_Chart.php: Added setTransparency() and
	setTransparencyLevel() so that you can control the background
	colour transparency. Also removed all of those old colour
	allocations as they were not needed.

2004-12-07 10:44  mike

	*
	CC_Components/CC_Query_Additions/CC_SelectList_Query_Addition.php:
	Snoop Mikey Mike is in the hizzouse. This amazing query addition
	uses a select list... add query's and filter like mad!

2004-12-07 09:08  jamie

	* CC_Graph.php: You can set the watermark now to be custom.

2004-12-03 16:26  patrick

	* cc_styles.css: Add a margin for ccSummaryStatus.

2004-12-01 12:27  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_Text_Field.php: Added a space before the
	disabled="true" string that gets added to the field.

2004-12-01 12:26  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_Credit_Card_Field.php: Added support for
	setDisabled() -- or rather, fixed getEditHTML() to recognized when
	setDisabled(true) was called on the field.

2004-11-30 12:12  patrick

	* CC_Graph.php: $logoPath now uses CC_FRAMEWORK_PATH instead of
	some other crazy method it was using to get the path to N2O.

2004-11-29 15:19  patrick

	* CC_Record.php: Removed a redundant check for required in
	createFieldObject().

2004-11-29 13:21  patrick

	* CC_Database.php: Change the from email in the alert message to
	cc_database_bot@coverallcrew.com. Upper-case letters belong not in
	email addresses.

2004-11-29 13:19  patrick

	* CC_Database.php: Add the REMOTE_ADDR to the email that gets sent
	so we know *who* is triggering the error!

2004-11-29 12:47  patrick

	* CC_Record.php, CC_Fields/CC_RadioButton_Field.php: Fixed up
	CC_Record's creation of a radio button field. You can now do
	value=blah or index=1 when you call
	$application->fieldManager->addField(...).

2004-11-26 09:52  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_Email_Field.php: Added a note in the comments to
	check the RFC (http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc3696.html) at a later
	date to update our validate() method so that *all* valid characters
	pass the validation.

2004-11-26 09:40  patrick

	* CC_Record.php: Don't create a new reference to the field manager
	when we can just reference it directly through the $application
	object.

2004-11-26 09:39  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_Email_Field.php: A plus sign (+) in the email
	address is actually valid.

2004-11-17 14:18  mike

	* CC_Components/CC_MultipleKey_Record.php: Made the keys and values
	in one almighty array $id. Updated the code to generate updates and
	inserts accordingly.

2004-11-16 13:51  mike

	* CC_Components/CC_MultipleKey_Record.php: Removed tracey from the
	office... wait... I mean removed debug code from this class.

2004-11-16 13:44  mike

	* CC_Components/CC_MultipleKey_Record.php: This is an amazing
	subclass of CC_Record. If your database table uses muliple keys,
	worry no more! Simple pass an array for the $id field (with each
	key value), and an array for the $idColumnName	(with each key).

2004-11-11 16:34  jamie

	* CC_Graph.php: Initialzied data variable.

2004-11-10 10:35  patrick

	* CC_Index.php: Removed some extra /'s in the
	requireAllFilesInFolder() calls() -- APPLICATION_PATH already ends
	in a slash.

2004-11-10 10:09  patrick

	* cc_styles.css: Make it so forms don't have any undesired margins;
	shrink the summary control row a bit...

2004-11-10 10:09  patrick

	* CC_Summary.php: Removed an implicit align="left" in the summary
	control row.

2004-11-10 10:08  patrick

	* CC_Record.php: Removed some debug output.

2004-11-09 10:25  patrick

	* CC_Database.php: Display the query properly in doBatchInsert()
	and doBatchUpdate() if it fails.

2004-11-08 17:07  patrick

	* CC_FieldManager.php: Fixed a bug where the args for a field
	weren't being indexed properly.

2004-11-08 16:03  patrick

	* CC_Database.php: Updated doUpdate() to return the number of
	affected rows. It used to return a boolean, and this change could
	potentially break code that was expected true on a query that
	updated 0 rows. If this is you, please let me know!

2004-11-08 15:57  patrick

	* CC_Database.php: Added doBatchInsert() and doBatchUpdate() so you
	can execute a series of queries in a single transaction. Will
	probably need to still adjust doUpdate() and doInsert() to allow
	one to not close the transaction after the query.

2004-11-08 13:07  jamie

	* CC_Utilities.php: Added the writeFile method. Make sure to remove
	this from your current projects. Exclian, PSAC, Pender and etrix
	Service Centre.
	
	Yay!

2004-11-02 17:26  patrick

	* CC_FieldManager.php, CC_Record.php,
	CC_Fields/CC_ProvinceState_Field.php: More memory improvements.
	CC_FieldManger now uses an numeric array to hold field data rather
	than an associative. The unselected value setting was moved from
	several places in CC_Record to the constructor of
	CC_ProvinceState_Field.

2004-11-02 17:04  patrick

	* CC_Download_Source.php: While it is neat to have a file sending
	headers with the filename "jamie_is_cool.gif", this file is not
	actually used anywhere, and doesn't really do anything as far as I
	can tell.

2004-11-02 17:00  patrick

	* CC_Handlers/CC_URL_Redirect_Handler.php: We won't be needing this
	anymore!

2004-11-02 16:56  patrick

	* CC_Handlers/CC_Krunk_Handler.php: Why the heck is this even in
	our code base??

2004-11-02 16:53  patrick

	* CC_ErrorManager.php: Simplified a bunch of stuff in the error
	manager:  - removed array and instance variables for buffer sizes;
	replaced with getBufferSize()  - consolidated a bunch of duplicate
	code in applicationErrorHandler()
	
	Say bye-bye to 96 lines of code!
	
	N2O is now using about 120K less memory than version 1.6 (testing
	using the service center application). Woo hoo!

2004-11-02 13:47  mike

	* CC_Summary.php: Fixed style bug.

2004-11-02 13:46  mike

	* CC_Image_Utilities.php: Logged a warning rather than window
	ERROR!!!

2004-11-02 13:44  mike

	* CC_Field.php, cc_styles.css: New style for error in the field
	labels.
	
	.ccLabelError
	
	enjoy!

2004-11-02 13:32  patrick

	* CC_Application.php, CC_URL_Redirect.php, _RequireOnceFiles.php:
	Minor spacing adjustments...

2004-11-02 13:32  patrick

	* CC_Record.php, CC_Fields/CC_Country_Field.php,
	CC_Fields/CC_ISO_Country_Field.php,
	CC_Fields/CC_ProvinceState_Field.php,
	CC_Fields/CC_SelectList_Field.php: In an effort to reduce memory
	usage, these fields which have enormous arrays of data no longer
	store said data in each instance of the field. Instead,
	getOptions() just returns the big array when it is needed.
	
	Also added a setEscapeValues() method to CC_SelectList_Field which
	tells the field whether or not it should use htmlspecialchars() on
	the value="" of the <option> tag it generates. This should be set
	false for select lists that have HTML entities like &eacute; and
	such.

2004-11-02 13:28  patrick

	* CC_Index.php: Whilst on the can, I thought of a more efficient
	way of looking for a button click. Rather than iterating through
	the entire request looking for three different kinds of button
	clicks, we now just iterate through all of the buttons in the
	current window, asking each button if it was clicked. As soon as a
	click is found, the loop stops.
	
	Also eliminated support for the CC_URL_Redirect_Handler, which
	wasn't a very good way of redirecting. The preferred way is to use
	the CC_Rewrite_Url_Handler which is much more flexible, and uses
	one less request to process.
	
	Say bye-bye to 54 lines of code!

2004-11-02 13:24  patrick

	* CC_Button.php, CC_Buttons/CC_Image_Button.php,
	CC_Buttons/CC_Text_Button.php: Added isClickInRequest() method to
	ask the button if it was clicked in the current request. Also added
	isGetRequest() to ask the button if it's the type who causes a GET
	rather than a POST.

2004-10-25 14:19  patrick

	* CC_Utilities.php, CC_Fields/CC_IntegerNumber_Field.php,
	CC_Fields/CC_Number_Field.php: Removed removeCommas() from
	CC_Utilities, as it was too simple to warrant its own function that
	will take up memory and increase compilation time.
	
	Also changed CC_IntegerNumber_Field and CC_Number_Field to strip
	the commas in setValue() instead of in validate(). If you're going
	to change the value like this, the proper way to do it is by
	overriding setValue(). ;)

2004-10-25 12:22  jamie

	* CC_Fields/: CC_IntegerNumber_Field.php, CC_Number_Field.php:
	Remove commas before validating.

2004-10-25 12:22  jamie

	* CC_Utilities.php: Added a remove commas method.

2004-10-21 11:46  mike

	* CC_Record.php: Account for keys with a period in them.

2004-10-15 11:39  mike

	* CC_Fields/CC_Text_Field.php: Added id option to text field.

2004-10-09 15:50  jamie

	* CC_Fields/CC_Multiple_File_Upload_Field.php: Added a reset field
	method. Dropping kids?

2004-10-05 15:54  jamie

	* CC_Handlers/CC_Summary_Reorder_Handler.php,
	CC_Summaries/CC_Ordered_Summary.php: Removed debug code.

2004-10-05 15:54  jamie

	* CC_Record.php, CC_Fields/CC_RadioButton.php,
	CC_Fields/CC_RadioButton_Field.php: Made sure the radio button
	field is proerly included in the record.

2004-09-29 14:38  patrick

	* CC_Database.php (version-1): Close the database connection!

2004-09-23 10:26  jamie

	* CC_Application.php: Language defualts to nothing, baby.

2004-09-22 21:51  jamie

	* CC_Application.php, CC_Field.php, CC_Record.php,
	CC_Fields/CC_Country_Field.php, CC_Fields/CC_ISO_Country_Field.php,
	CC_Fields/CC_ProvinceState_Field.php: Added support for languages
	in CC_Application and French support for the Country and
	State/Province Fields.

2004-09-22 20:50  jamie

	* CC_Field.php: Starting the globalization process.

2004-09-20 14:02  mike

	* CC_Fields/CC_Domain_Field.php: Support TLD up to 4 chars.

2004-09-17 16:37  jamie

	* CC_Graph.php: Modified CC_Graph to be BETTER!!!

2004-09-17 11:05  jamie

	* CC_Graph.php: The x-axis table field can now be set dynamically.

2004-09-14 11:18  patrick

	* CC_Utilities.php, CC_Window.php,
	CC_Fields/CC_AutoSubmit_Select_Field.php,
	CC_Fields/CC_Foreign_Key_Field.php,
	CC_Fields/CC_Multiple_SelectList_Field.php,
	CC_Fields/CC_RadioButton_Field.php,
	CC_Fields/CC_SelectList_Field.php: I'm noticing some segmentation
	faults in Apache since we started using the turck-mmcache. After
	some digging, someone said they solved it by changing functions
	like:
	
	function myFunction($options = array())
	
	... to:
	
	function myFunction($options = null) {	if ($options == null)	{  
		    $options == array();    } }
	
	So, let's see if it makes a difference!

2004-09-08 11:45  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_SelectList_Field.php: Was missing a closing quote in
	the class="" parameter of the select tag!

2004-08-26 12:10  patrick

	* CC_Buttons/CC_Image_Button.php: Fixed getHTML() to use the style
	that has been set.

2004-08-25 14:16  patrick

	* CC_Field.php, CC_Window.php,
	CC_Fields/CC_AutoSubmit_Select_Field.php,
	CC_Fields/CC_Checkbox_Field.php, CC_Fields/CC_Password_Field.php,
	CC_Fields/CC_SelectList_Field.php, CC_Fields/CC_TextArea_Field.php,
	CC_Fields/CC_Text_Field.php: Added support for tabindex into the
	fields. The order in which you register components determines the
	order in which elements are tabbed.

2004-08-25 14:16  patrick

	* CC_Summary.php: Register the buttons of a CC_Summary in a more
	intuitive manner so that tabbing goes from left to right, top to
	bottom.

2004-08-25 14:15  patrick

	* CC_Button.php: The default button now gets a tabindex of 1
	instead of 0. This seems to better follow the W3C spec.

2004-08-24 20:15  patrick

	* CC_Handlers/CC_Insert_Record_Handler.php: Set the default state
	of $insertAction to false. This way, things will actually *work*
	when you pass in false as your $insertAction!

2004-08-19 15:31  patrick

	* CC_Application.php: Missed an occurence of argumentExists().

2004-08-18 21:33  patrick

	* CC_Database.php: Do a PEAR::isError() check on the results before
	doing stuff on it.

2004-08-18 21:25  patrick

	* CC_Index.php, CC_Record.php, CC_Window.php,
	CC_Fields/CC_Foreign_Key_Field.php,
	CC_Windows/CC_Add_FK_Record_Window.php,
	CC_Windows/CC_Add_Ordered_Record_Window.php,
	CC_Windows/CC_Add_Record_Window.php,
	CC_Windows/CC_Delete_Confirm_Window.php,
	CC_Windows/CC_Delete_Multiple_Confirm_Window.php,
	CC_Windows/CC_Delete_Ordered_Confirm_Window.php,
	CC_Windows/CC_Edit_Ordered_Record_Window.php,
	CC_Windows/CC_Edit_Record_Window.php,
	CC_Windows/CC_View_Ordered_Record_Window.php,
	CC_Windows/CC_View_Record_Window.php: Switch argumentExists() calls
	to hasArgument().

2004-08-18 21:24  patrick

	* CC_RelationshipManager.php: Do a proper PEAR::isError() check
	after doing queries.

2004-08-11 15:15  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_File_Upload_Field.php: Fixed a huge bug in the file
	upload field that caused an infinite loop to occur if you uploaded
	the same file without any extensions three or more times. Thanks to
	James Nedila for bringing light to this.

2004-08-11 09:24  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_Multiple_File_Upload_Field.php: $fileList is
	actually a pipe-delimited list, not comma-delimited as the docs
	say.

2004-08-11 09:15  patrick

	* ChangeLog: Updated ChangeLog

2004-08-10 12:18  jamie

	* CC_Fields/CC_AutoSubmit_Select_Field.php: Added more checks for
	omitting buttons.

2004-08-04 11:23  patrick

	* CC_Image_Utilities.php, CC_Fields/CC_Image_Upload_Field.php:
	Thumbnails will always be in the .png format now -- it just makes
	things a lot easier this way.

2004-08-03 18:24  patrick

	* ChangeLog: Updated ChangeLog.

2004-08-03 18:23  patrick

	* CC_Window.php, CC_Fields/CC_File_Upload_Field.php,
	CC_Fields/CC_Multiple_File_Upload_Field.php: Fixed a problem where
	the custom error message of CC_File_Upload_Field's validate()
	method was been over-written by a generic message in CC_Window. As
	a result, the user would have never known that the reason there was
	an error was because it was the wrong file type.

2004-08-03 18:22  patrick

	* CC_Components/CC_Image_Folder_Component.php: Added
	setNumColumns() so you can set this number *after* you construct
	the component.

2004-08-03 18:22  patrick

	* CC_Components/CC_Folder_Component.php: Added setReverseFilter()
	so you can filter files that you *do* want to see (the default is
	to filter what you *don't* want to see).

2004-08-02 17:53  jamie

	* CC_Utilities.php: Added deleteAssociativeArrayElement.

2004-07-31 17:00  mike

	* CC_Handlers/CC_Delete_Record_Handler.php: Set multipleClick to
	false by default.

2004-07-31 16:54  mike

	* CC_Handlers/CC_Delete_Ordered_Record_Handler.php: Set
	multipleClick to default to false.

2004-07-30 18:16  mike

	* CC_Database.php, CC_Window.php,
	CC_Fields/CC_File_Upload_Field.php: Get ordered insert working
	properly (was this ever tested, in the history of the universe?).
	Get files uploaded too!

2004-07-30 17:49  mike

	* CC_Handlers/CC_Insert_Ordered_Record_Handler.php: Default
	multiple click to false, poo poo head.

2004-07-30 14:43  jamie

	* CC_Summaries/CC_Ordered_Summary.php (version-1): Overrode
	getViewEditDeleteLinkButton.

2004-07-30 14:05  jamie

	* CC_Record.php (version-1): Changed loop condition for adding
	ordered records.

2004-07-30 11:12  patrick

	* CC_Record.php: CC_Multiple_File_Upload_Field now accepts
	"uploadPath" argument from the field manager so you can override
	the path to which uploads files go.

2004-07-30 10:13  mike

	* CC_Fields/CC_File_Upload_Field.php: Added a way to set the
	rootSavePath.

2004-07-15 17:01  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_SelectList_Field.php: Added support for
	setDisabled().

2004-07-07 17:53  patrick

	* CC_Window.php: Added setStatusMessage(), getStatusMessage,
	clearStatusMessage(), and hasStatus(). You can now set status
	messages for windows that aren't error messages. This is useful,
	for example, because after updating a record in a window, you
	should indicate to the user that the action completed successfully,
	and it should look different than an error message.

2004-07-07 17:52  patrick

	* cc_styles.css: Added ccStatus style for the new status messages
	of windows.

2004-07-06 16:25  patrick

	* CC_Pie_Chart.php: Removed an old line of code which attempted to
	output the title onto the image. The new way is better.

2004-07-06 12:23  patrick

	* CC_Pie_Chart.php: More doc fixes.

2004-07-06 12:21  patrick

	* CC_Pie_Chart.php: Looks like the phpdoc tool doesn't like </p>'s.

2004-07-06 12:10  patrick

	* CC_Pie_Chart.php: Improved the documentation (including an
	example of how to use the class), fixed the drawing of the title
	(it wasn't doing it before), and made the drawing of the title
	optional.

2004-06-29 14:53  mike

	* CC_Fields/CC_ProvinceState_Field.php: If we are abbreviating the
	list of states/provinces make sure to put the n/a option into it's
	own array.

2004-06-28 16:20  patrick

	* CC_Summary.php, CC_Handlers/CC_Delete_Record_Handler.php,
	CC_Handlers/CC_Summary_Record_Handler.php,
	CC_Windows/CC_Delete_Confirm_Window.php,
	CC_Windows/CC_Edit_Record_Window.php,
	CC_Windows/CC_View_Record_Window.php: Fixed a bug where the
	view/edit/delete windows (and respective handlers) were not paying
	attention to the idColumn of the parent CC_Summary.

2004-06-22 11:37  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_Multiple_File_Upload_Field.php: Some critical fixes
	to removeDeletedUploadFields() to avoid PHP calls on non-objects.
	This entire class is getting really complicated, so we should look
	at simplifying it one of these days.

2004-06-21 21:33  patrick

	* CC_Handlers/CC_Remove_File_Handler.php: Passing in a cc_record
	now actually works.

2004-06-17 17:14  jamie

	* CC_Fields/CC_SelectList_Field.php: Fixed a bug with
	getDisplayValue when there was an unselected value present. Booga
	booga!!!

2004-06-15 16:24  mike

	* CC_User.php: Updated the setUserName and getUserName methods to
	use the case $username.

2004-05-29 15:17  patrick

	returning it.

2004-05-29 10:29  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_Credit_Card_Field.php: getMaskedNumber() now only
	does the masking if there is a number.

2004-05-28 16:00  patrick

	* CC_Index.php (version-1): Ugh...

2004-05-28 15:57  patrick

	* CC_Fields/_RequireOnceFiles.php (version-1): More krunk to
	comment out!

2004-05-28 15:56  patrick

	* _RequireOnceFiles.php, CC_Buttons/CC_Sort_Button.php,
	CC_Fields/CC_AutoSubmit_Select_Field.php,

	CC_Handlers/CC_RemoveFileFromPathHandlr.php (version-1): Removed
	require_once lines.

	* CC_Handlers/:
	CC_Multiple_Selections_Handlers/CC_Delete_Multiple_Selections_Handler.php,
	CC_Remove_File_Handler.php (version-1): This file was missing the
	closing ?> tag!

2004-05-28 15:46  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_Date_Added_Field.php,
	CC_Handlers/CC_Multiple_Selections_Handler.php (version-1): This
	file was missing the closing ?> tag!

2004-05-18 13:13  patrick

	* CC_Database.php (version-1), CC_Database.php: Store the password
	and datasource strings in a more secure fashion so not just anyone
	can go look at the session file and get the passwords for our
	precious databases!

2004-05-13 09:55  patrick

	* CC_Summary.php: The add handler wasn't being constructed with the
	correct label in register().

2004-05-13 09:51  patrick

	* CC_Summary.php: $this->addWindow was not defined.

2004-05-05 09:54  mike

	* CC_Fields/CC_SelectList_Field.php: Fixed getViewHTML to return
	either the correct value, or if a value hasn't been set return the
	current index's value.

2004-04-30 14:06  patrick

	* CC_Database.php: doDelete() was throwing an E_USER_ERROR instead
	of E_USER_WARNING.

2004-04-20 09:53  patrick

	* CC_Config.php, CC_Database.php: Set default database alert email
	to support@coverallcrew.com, not crew@.

2004-04-16 12:33  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_Date_Field.php: Added reset() method to reset the
	date; changed getViewHTML() to display a "-" if there is no date
	set, and setAllowBlankValue(true) is used.

2004-04-15 15:39  patrick

	* CC_Database.php: Added doGetRow() -- a way to easily get one row
	from a query.

2004-04-15 13:22  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_Date_Field.php: Added setValue() to pass in a
	YYYY-MM-DD string and have it parsed nicely.

2004-04-15 11:07  patrick

	* CC_Handlers/CC_Manage_OneToMany_Handler.php: Used setObject()
	instead of setArgument() when passing an object in.

2004-04-15 11:07  patrick

	* CC_Windows/CC_OneToMany_Window.php: Fixed summary to construct
	properly (still using old CC_Framework constructor). We also show
	if the item is selected, even in read-only mode.

2004-04-15 11:06  patrick

	* CC_Summary_Content_Providers/CC_OneToMany_Check_Provider.php:
	Added ability to make the checkboxes be read-only.

2004-04-15 11:05  patrick

2004-04-14 12:42  patrick

	review changes since Feb 11, and test all the changes.

2004-04-14 10:40  patrick

	* CC_Record.php: The expiry field wasn't been created by reference.

2004-04-14 10:39  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_Expiry_Date_Field.php: Make the start and end year
	of this field be a little smarter so we don't have to keep updating
	it.

2004-04-13 14:51  patrick

	* CC_Window.php: argumentExists() is now deprecated. Use
	hasArgument() instead.

2004-04-07 20:11  jamie

	* CC_Button.php: Added proper button disabling.

2004-04-07 11:52  patrick

	* CC_Fields/: CC_AutoSubmit_Select_Field.php,
	CC_Multiple_SelectList_Field.php, CC_SelectList_Field.php: Removed
	the new-line character at the end of the getHTML(). If someone
	wants one, they should have the choice of adding it themselves.

2004-04-05 20:52  patrick

	* CC_Summary_Filters/CC_Sprintf_Filter.php: Added a generic
	sprintf() filter so that you can use the same class to produce a
	wide range of results. The only limit is what sprintf() can do.

2004-04-05 20:32  patrick

	* CC_Summary_Filters/CC_DateTime_Filter.php: Made more flexible so
	you can supress the time.

2004-04-05 20:04  patrick

	* CC_Components/CC_Summary_Search_Component.php: The search
	component now uses a style of "ccSummarySearch", so you can
	override it if you want it to appear in a particular way.

2004-04-05 20:03  patrick

	* CC_Summary.php: Optimized the way we use styles for the rows.
	Thanks to Luke Andrews of http://attaboy.ca/, we now specify the
	style for the entire row rather than for each cell.

2004-04-05 20:02  patrick

	* cc_styles.css: Revised and added some new styles. Hopefully it
	won't break too much!

2004-04-02 13:48  patrick

	* CC_Database.php: Added doGetOne() to return the first column of
	the first row of a query. Handy for stats queries.

2004-04-01 14:17  patrick

	* CC_Utilities.php: Added getStackTrace() which returns a string of
	all the classes and functions that were called to get to the point
	of code where you call getStackTrace(). This will help debugging
	certain things a *LOT* easier.

2004-03-29 14:39  mike

	* CC_Database.php, CC_Handlers/CC_Summary_Reorder_Handler.php:
	Fixed the Reorder Handler to properly get the affected number of
	rows after a delete.

2004-03-28 15:40  patrick

	* CC_Handlers/CC_Download_XLS_Summary_Handler.php: Made the columns
	a little wider.

2004-03-28 15:36  patrick

	* CC_Database.php: Internally scramble the database encode password
	so it is not readable in the session file.

2004-03-25 13:15  patrick

2004-03-25 13:05  patrick

	* CC_Image_Utilities.php, CC_Fields/CC_Image_Upload_Field.php:
	Image thumbnail generation is better now. If the image is smaller
	than the desired icon, an icon is created of the desired size, and
	then the original image is pasted in the middle of it.

2004-03-22 15:53  patrick

	* CC_Index.php, _RequireOnceFiles.php: Moved the inclusion of
	CC_Image_Utilities.php into the _RequireOnceFiles.php file.

2004-03-21 16:04  jamie

	* CC_Handlers/CC_Summary_Reorder_Handler.php: Make sure that
	sorting doesn't overrun the rows array! Yee haw!!

2004-03-21 15:45  jamie

	* CC_Window.php: Some good debug code for future use.

2004-03-20 17:03  jamie

	to allow for other handlers.

2004-03-19 18:45  jamie

	* CC_Summaries/CC_Ordered_Summary.php: pass the record id to
	sortHandlerClass.

2004-03-19 18:43  jamie

	handler for when a sort happens.

2004-03-19 13:43  mike

	* CC_Summaries/CC_Ordered_Summary.php: Fixed this ordered summary
	to match the regular summary in terms of count(*).

	way the add handler gets constructed and did some ordered updates.

2004-03-16 17:56  mike

	* CC_Components/CC_Folder_Component.php: Plop on a slash for the
	folder name if one wasn't there.

2004-03-15 14:02  patrick

	* CC_Handlers/: CC_Summary_JumpPage_Handler.php,
	CC_Summary_Next_Handler.php, CC_Summary_Num_Rows_Handler.php,
	CC_Summary_Previous_Handler.php, CC_Summary_Refresh_Handler.php,
	CC_Summary_Reorder_Handler.php: Force updates on the summaries in
	case we get fast clickers like Jamie. (CC_Summary has an update
	threshold which will skip an update if it's within the timeout. It
	defaults to 2 seconds.)

2004-03-15 13:58  patrick

	* CC_Handlers/CC_Summary_Sort_Handler.php: Force an update of the
	summary.

2004-03-14 11:13  patrick

	* CC_Application.php: Fixed setActionArguments() to strstr() on
	$action instead of $this->action.

2004-03-12 12:46  patrick

	* CC_Summary.php: Only display the warning in update() if DEBUG is
	enabled.

2004-03-11 17:01  patrick

	* CC_Summary.php: Trigger an error warning if update() is skipped.

2004-03-11 17:01  patrick

	* CC_Buttons/: CC_AnchorImage_Button.php, CC_Sort_Button.php,
	CC_Text_Button.php: Typo!!

2004-03-11 16:51  patrick

	* CC_Buttons/: CC_AnchorImage_Button.php, CC_Text_Button.php: Fixed
	getHTML() to add the pageIdKey.

2004-03-11 16:49  patrick

	* CC_Buttons/CC_Sort_Button.php: Fixes to getHTML() to include the
	pageIdKey in the URL.

2004-03-11 13:00  mike

	* CC_Components/: CC_Folder_Component.php,
	CC_Image_Folder_Component.php: Updates to defer updating the folder
	view/image view until after it has been registerd.

2004-03-11 12:57  jamie

	* CC_Summaries/CC_Ordered_Summary.php: ccDie to cc_die

2004-03-10 14:40  mike

	* CC_Components/CC_Folder_Component.php: Optionally show the
	directory name in the listing. (pass false in the getHTML() method
	to NOT show it.

2004-03-10 14:39  mike

	directory name in the listing.

2004-03-09 13:02  jamie

	* CC_Application.php: Removed debug code.

2004-03-07 21:50  patrick

	* CC_Handlers/CC_URL_Redirect_Handler.php: Added warning output in
	the constructor suggesting that developers may want to use the
	CC_Rewrite_Url_Handler instead. This handler works differently, and
	uses a part of CC_Index that I'd like to see removed. I decided to
	add this warning, because the two handlers are easily mistaken, and
	I used this one when I actually wanted the other. I was like, "why
	on earth do I have to click twice on buttons for it to take me
	where they want to go?!"

2004-03-07 21:47  patrick

	* CC_Application.php, CC_Index.php, CC_Window.php: First round
	checkin for support of multiple instances of the same window. Use
	getWindow(<name>, <key>), registerWindow(<name>, <key>),
	setAction(<name>, <key>), etc. <key> is optional of course, and the
	previous calls will all work just the same as they did before.

2004-03-04 17:24  mike

	* CC_Image_Utilities.php: Fixed Image utilities to create proper
	thumbnails.

2004-03-04 14:22  mike

	* CC_Image_Utilities.php: Fixed the thumbnail path.

2004-03-04 14:04  mike

	* CC_Handlers/CC_Delete_Image_Folder_File_Handler.php: If we are
	deleting from the Image Folder, make sure to delete the thumbnails
	as well...

2004-03-04 13:06  mike

	* CC_Image_Utilities.php: Added an option to turn off automatic
	thumbnail generation when calling the getThumbnail method.

2004-03-03 16:16  mike

	* CC_Fields/CC_SelectList_Field.php: Added the component id to the
	select list. Look at the setId method is CC_Field for more info...

2004-03-03 16:13  mike

	* CC_Components/CC_Image_Folder_Component.php: Many improvements,
	much of them reflected in the CC_Folder_Component as well. boo-yaa!

2004-03-03 16:11  mike

	* CC_Components/CC_Folder_Component.php: Added better path
	checking, a check for if the file is a directory, download button,
	and ability to customize the delete button handler.

2004-03-03 16:09  mike

	* CC_Window.php: Added isComponentRegistered() - does pretty much
	what you think it does.

2004-03-03 11:51  jamie

	* CC_Fields/CC_SelectList_Field.php: Removed the comments that were
	killing the world.

2004-03-03 11:50  jamie

	* CC_Fields/CC_AutoSubmit_Select_Field.php: StrCMP, baby!!

2004-03-03 06:29  jamie

	* _RequireOnceFiles.php: Added Pie Chart to this.

2004-03-03 06:29  jamie

	* CC_Pie_Chart.php: Add this thing already.

2004-03-03 06:28  jamie

	* CC_Fields/: CC_RadioButton_Field.php, CC_SelectList_Field.php:
	Moved some methods to the superclass.

2004-03-03 06:27  jamie

	* CC_Fields/CC_Multiple_Choice_Field.php: Added generic options
	handling.

2004-03-02 18:20  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_Image_Upload_Field.php: Fixed getDisplayWidth() and
	getDisplayHeight() to return the image's width and height in the
	case that the display width and height haven't been set. TODO: add
	getImageWidth() and getImageHeight().

2004-03-02 15:48  patrick

	* CC_Window.php: Suppressed a PHP warning when peeking in the
	$_FILES array.

2004-03-02 15:47  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_Multiple_File_Upload_Field.php: Fixed
	getUploadField() to make sure $index >=
	sizeof($this->uploadFieldArray) rather than just greater than.
	Apparently, given an empty array, the following bit of code will
	actually create an empty element in the array:
	
	return $this->uploadFieldArray[0];
	
	That's PHP for you!

2004-02-26 22:13  patrick

	* CC_Application.php, CC_Index.php: Created functions getFormOpen()
	and getFormClose() in CC_Application. Now, on a given page, you can
	split the form up so that hitting return in certain fields or
	records will trigger selected buttons.

2004-02-26 22:10  patrick

	* CC_Fields/: CC_File_Upload_Field.php,
	CC_Multiple_File_Upload_Field.php: Added ability to disable the
	delete functionality in the file upload fields.
	
	CC_Multiple_File_Upload_Field.php only: overrode the register()
	method of CC_Field, and deferred the registering of the
	$addMoreFilesButton until the field itself is registered.

2004-02-26 22:08  patrick

	* CC_Handlers/CC_Remove_File_Handler.php: Fixed handler to accept a
	CC_Record, CC_MultipleFileUpload_Field, or CC_FileUpload_Field.
	Please note that you have to attach this handler to your
	update/save button if you want the deleting to work in the file
	upload fields.

2004-02-26 12:12  mike

	* CC_Utilities.php: Update the parseOMatic to take a boolean option
	to use a file or use the passed string.

2004-02-24 16:21  patrick

	* CC_Field.php: Added note in docs for setDisabled() to say that
	not all fields have made use of this feature yet.

2004-02-24 16:20  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_Text_Field.php: Added support for setDisabled().

2004-02-21 10:26  patrick

	new disabled and id variables.

2004-02-16 13:03  mike

	* CC_Field.php: Added two amazing new features to fields. 1)
	Ability to disable the field with the setDisabled() method, 2)
	Ability to set the id entity of a field with the setId() method.
	Look at the CC_Checkbox getEditHTML() method to see these in
	action.

2004-02-16 12:35  patrick

	* CC_Record.php: Added support for the cc_autosubmit_select_field
	field. Previously, this field had to be constructed manually.

2004-02-16 12:34  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_AutoSubmit_Select_Field.php: Moved the registering
	of the button to the register() callback; added a getButton()
	method.

2004-02-12 13:57  mike

	* CC_Components/CC_Image_Folder_Component.php: Added list view to
	folder, joining the very popular icon view!

2004-02-12 13:42  mike

	* CC_Index.php: require the CC_Image_Utilities

2004-02-12 13:41  mike

	* CC_Components/CC_Folder_Component.php: Changes to the
	CC_Folder_Component so that subclasses such as
	CC_Image_Folder_Component work nicely.

2004-02-12 13:40  mike

	* CC_Image_Utilities.php: A toolbox of image manipulation things...
	get the dimensions of an image, create a thumbnail, the
	posibilities are endless!

2004-02-12 13:39  mike

	* CC_Components/CC_Image_Folder_Component.php: Viewing images in a
	folder has never been more fun! This will take all the images in a
	folder, create thumbnails, and layout the images in a table.

2004-02-11 17:01  patrick

	* ChangeLog: Latest ChangeLog for N2O version 1.5.4

2004-02-11 17:00  patrick

	* CC_Record.php: Checkboxes were not being checked if the field
	manager had a checked=1. I don't feel like explaining everything,
	but the bottom line is that it was because PHP considers 0 and an
	empty variable to be the same. This is where the === operator comes
	in handy, as it also checks type (so $test === 0 is only true if
	$test is an integer 0, where is $test == 0 is true if $test is 0 or
	blank).

2004-02-11 10:57  patrick

	* CC_Handlers/CC_Button_Click_Handler.php: Add a handler to click a
	button.

2004-02-10 10:58  mike

	the folder after adding/removing filters.

2004-02-10 10:01  mike

	filtering out files containing specific strings (ie: .jpg). Also a
	method to clear all filters that have been applied to a folder.

2004-02-09 16:31  patrick

	* ChangeLog: Latest ChangeLog for N2O version 1.5.3.

2004-02-09 16:18  patrick

	* CC_Index.php: We no longer make a call to session_name() if
	$session_name is not set.

2004-02-06 14:29  patrick

	* CC_Record.php: Added support to be able to specify key/value
	pairs for a CC_SelectList_Field using the field manager.
	Previously, you could only do: 'options=Blue,Red,Green'. Now, you
	can do: 'options=blue=Cobalt Blue,red=Dried Blood Red,green=Snot
	Green'.

2004-02-06 12:44  patrick

	* CC_Summary.php: Added margin around the table when no records are
	found.

2004-02-05 16:45  patrick

	* CC_FieldManager.php: Changed the way we parse the parameters for
	the field manager so that you can have an equals sign in the value.

2004-02-05 16:28  patrick

	* CC_Record.php: Forgot to add support for the whereClause if you
	didn't specify an orderBy column.

2004-02-05 16:15  patrick

	* CC_Record.php: Added the ability to specify a whereClause
	parameter for CC_Foreign_Key_Fields...

2004-02-05 16:15  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_Foreign_Key_Field.php: Fixed bug in
	getDisplayValue() where it was return $unselectedValue instead of
	$this->unselectedValue.

2004-02-05 16:13  patrick

	* CC_Summary_Filters/CC_File_Size_Filter.php,
	CC_Components/CC_Folder_Component.php: Created a
	CC_File_Size_Filter class; modified CC_Folder_Component to use it
	rather than its own code.

2004-02-05 16:07  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_SelectList_Field.php: Another small fix to
	getSelectedIndex(). When checking to see if the value of the field
	is the unselected value, we now compare it with
	$this->_unselectedValueValue.

2004-02-05 13:30  patrick

	CC_Record.php: Replaced is_int with cc_is_int.

2003-12-24 18:23  jamie

	* CC_Graph.php: Fade the N2O logo a bit.

2003-12-16 15:23  jamie

	* CC_Record.php: Check if x and y both exists for textarea args.

2003-11-28 10:18  mike

	* CC_Fields/CC_Multiple_File_Upload_Field.php: Switched over to
	remove files with a checkbox rather than a button.

2003-11-28 10:15  mike

	* CC_Handlers/CC_Remove_File_Handler.php: Repurposed this file to
	scan for files checked as deleted, and them go ahead and delete
	'em. Before this file was used with the 'Remove' (no longer
	existing).

2003-11-28 10:07  mike

	* CC_Fields/CC_File_Upload_Field.php: Removed the remove button,
	replaced it with a checkbox for good times.

2003-11-28 10:04  mike

2003-11-27 12:37  mike

	* CC_Record.php, CC_Handlers/CC_Manage_FK_Table_Handler.php:
	Constructed the foreign key properly (with new options, setting
	correct options, and making sure it is either editable/viewable)

2003-11-27 11:52  mike

	* CC_Handlers/CC_Summary_Record_Handler.php: Check if we have a
	request variable already set in the targetWindow, if we do use an
	'&' rather than '?' to join the rest of the request vars.

2003-11-26 18:43  mike

	* CC_Handlers/CC_Insert_FK_Record_Handler.php: Set the
	'recentlyAddedFKKeyValue' key to include to field name so multiple
	foreign keys can exist peacefully on one page.

2003-11-26 18:42  mike

	* CC_Record.php: Set the updated foreign key field to the newly
	generated field (set selected to the additional value if added).
	Also set the key to include to field name so multiple foreign keys
	can exist peacefully on one page.

2003-11-26 18:13  mike

	* CC_Handlers/CC_Insert_FK_Record_Handler.php: Switched up setting
	the argument to key 'recentlyAddedForeignKeyValue' (with the value
	of the inserted record), rather than the foreign key field name
	because the key 'recentlyAddedForeignKeyValue' is already being
	used in CC_Record. I think it is safer to change the key name here,
	rather than in CC_Record.

2003-11-26 18:09  mike

	* CC_Window.php: For some reason foreign key updating was
	completely removed from N2O. Updated getRecordAtIndex (passing in
	the boolean to update foreign keys). Updated getRecord to update

2003-11-26 11:57  mike

	methods with good ones.

2003-11-26 11:45  mike

	passed to the parent, since it doesn't exist.

2003-11-26 11:43  mike

	* CC_FieldManager.php: Set the fieldData['args'] to blank string if
	there are no arguments. This eliminates those pesky 'Undefined
	index: args' messages.	All good? Can this krunk something?

2003-11-26 11:31  mike

	* CC_Fields/CC_File_Upload_Field.php: fixed the path, so the image
	can be seen, not heard.

	Updated the default windows... to the extreme.x

	* CC_Index.php: Added check for $cookiePath.

2003-11-22 13:01  patrick

	* CC_Config.php: Added $cookiePath setting so you can override the
	path to the session cookie.

2003-11-22 12:08  jamie

	* CC_Summary.php, CC_Handlers/CC_Summary_Num_Rows_Handler.php,
	CC_Handlers/CC_Summary_Sort_Handler.php: Set summary preference
	cookies based on the session name as well as the summary name.

2003-11-22 11:24  jamie

	* CC_Summary_Filters/CC_Text_Shortening_Popup_Filter.php: Added
	this crazy filter to N2O!

2003-11-19 14:15  patrick

	* CC_Handlers/CC_Click_Button_Handler.php: Added handler to click a
	button.

2003-11-18 22:56  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_Credit_Card_Field.php: Corrected validate() to
	return false when the checkSum fails.

2003-11-18 17:39  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_Password_Field.php: Added setRequireAlphaNumeric()
	so you can make a password only validate if it has both letters AND
	numbers.

2003-11-18 12:36  patrick

	* CC_Handlers/CC_Insert_Record_Handler.php: Removed debug line.

2003-11-18 11:54  patrick

	* CC_Field.php: getViewHTML() wasn't returning $this->getValue(),
	so no text was being displayed when there was no inputStyle!

2003-11-17 21:39  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_Password_Field.php: validate() should set the error
	message to CC_FIELD_ERROR_CUSTOM.

2003-11-17 20:44  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_SelectList_Field.php: $index was being incremented
	in getSelectedIndex() in the wrong place.

2003-11-17 20:03  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_SelectList_Field.php: Fixed setSelectedIndex() and
	getSelectedIndex() to take into account the unselectedValue(). If
	there is an unselectedValue, I would assume that
	setSelectedIndex(0) would set it to the unselected value, but
	previously it did not.

2003-11-16 15:47  patrick

	* CC_Database.php: Removed debug code...

2003-11-16 15:33  patrick

	CC_CheckBox_Field which return alternate, user-friendly (and
	unfriendly) values.

2003-11-16 13:28  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_Image_Upload_Field.php: [no log message]

2003-11-16 01:37  jamie

	* CC_Components/CC_Summary_Search_Component.php: Midle was
	mispelled.

2003-11-16 00:29  jamie

	* CC_Fields/CC_Multiple_Choice_Field.php: Fixed a bug when
	assigning multiple required values for a field.

	alternating row colours.

	documention for the parseOMatic().

2003-11-14 19:52  mike

	with icon size.

	CC_Fields/CC_Text_Field.php: Added input style to differentiate
	between label and input styles.

2003-11-13 20:51  jamie

	* CC_Fields/CC_Expiry_Date_Field.php: Moved getMMYYValue fcns to

2003-11-12 03:25  jamie

2003-11-10 12:04  jamie

	* CC_Fields/CC_Multiple_Choice_Field.php: Added a todo comment

2003-11-05 12:43  patrick

	* CC_Record.php: Added optionalValue parameter to the
	cc_checkbox_field.

	CC_Handlers/CC_Delete_Ordered_Record_Handler.php,
	CC_Handlers/CC_Delete_Record_Handler.php: Fixes to some uses of
	getRecord($key).

2003-11-02 13:28  patrick

	CC_Windows/CC_Add_Ordered_Record_Window.php,
	CC_Windows/CC_Add_Record_Window.php,

	CC_Windows/CC_View_Ordered_Record_Window.php,

	isRecordRegisteredAtIndex() to CC_Window, updated all the default
	windows to not use getRecord($key).

2003-11-02 13:10  patrick

	* CC_Window.php: Broke (on purpose) the getRecord($key) method, as
	that whole record key thing is troublesome. It does not allow you
	to register two records that both use the same table and ID. Plus,
	I'm pretty sure we no longer use it anymore anyhow.
	getRecordAtIndex() is the preferred way.

2003-11-02 12:13  patrick

	* CC_Application.php: Used reference operator when constructing a
	bunch of things in the constructor and in setUser().

	* CC_Summary.php: Removed debug code.

2003-10-30 17:25  patrick

	* CC_Handlers/CC_Download_XLS_Summary_Handler.php: Remove debug
	code.

2003-10-30 17:20  patrick

	* CC_Summary.php: Rewrote getRawSummary() because it wasn't working
	with Postgres.

2003-10-30 16:43  patrick

	* CC_Summary.php: Added debug code to getRawSummary().

2003-10-30 16:33  patrick

	* CC_Database.php: Line 993 had an unquoted string.

2003-10-30 16:31  patrick

	* CC_Handlers/CC_Download_XLS_Summary_Handler.php: Added debug
	output.

2003-10-28 12:13  jamie

2003-10-24 15:51  patrick

	in constructor. Value can be anything, not just a float.

2003-10-22 16:18  patrick

	the button was inserted.

2003-10-22 16:16  patrick

2003-10-21 11:48  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_Image_Upload_Field.php: Added additional MIME types
	to support IE for Windows (which breaks the standard).

	were able to add the record, and if not, set a window error

	database.

2003-10-11 15:29  patrick

	* CC_Index.php: We still want to update the pageId during a

2003-10-10 22:04  patrick

	* CC_Summary.php: If there's an error in the query, we now display
	the error inside the summary rather than barfing in a really ugly
	way.

2003-10-10 21:35  patrick

	* CC_Database.php: Only trigger warnings when queries fail, and
	instead return the PEAR error object. This can be tested for using
	PEAR::isError($result).

2003-10-10 20:01  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_DateTime_Field.php: Shortened unselected values for
	minutes and seconds.

	textFriendlyProcessValue().

2003-10-09 18:07  patrick

	* CC_Handlers/CC_Download_XLS_Summary_Handler.php: Force
	writeNumber() on data that passes is_numeric(). (write() does not
	seem to properly detect this).

2003-10-09 10:44  mike

	* CC_Buttons/CC_AnchorText_Button.php: Smarter target usage.

2003-10-06 23:09  patrick

	Multiple selections broke and I fixed them.

2003-10-05 02:48  jamie

	* CC_Windows/CC_Delete_Multiple_Confirm_Window.php: Multiple
	deleting and processing broke somehow and I fixed it.

2003-10-05 02:47  jamie

	* CC_Handlers/CC_Delete_Multiple_Records_Handler.php: Multiple
	deleting broke somehow and I fixed it.

2003-10-04 21:35  patrick

	getExtraSummaryButtons().

2003-10-04 21:33  patrick

	Download Tab-Delimited File.

2003-10-04 11:44  mike

	* CC_Handlers/CC_Summary_Search_Handler.php: Testing adding
	mulitple query additions to the search handler.

2003-10-02 16:03  mike

	* CC_Handlers/CC_Download_XLS_Summary_Handler.php: Use the summary
	display name for the filename.

	quotes around the order by clause.

2003-10-02 13:13  mike

	just an alias to strstr).

2003-10-02 13:02  mike

	* CC_Handlers/CC_Download_ZIP_Summary_Handler.php: replaced
	getTabDelimitedSummary with getRawSummary (passing true to get tab
	delimited version of that).

2003-10-02 13:02  jamie

	sortable when downloading raw dat

2003-10-02 12:52  jamie

2003-10-01 21:10  patrick

	redirect within the application url.

2003-09-30 11:09  patrick

2003-09-30 00:08  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_Foreign_Key_Field.php: Only construct the add button

	that may conflict with another).

2003-09-29 22:43  patrick

2003-09-29 08:01  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_File_Upload_Field.php: getDetailsHTML() now returns
	a direct link to the file. This will help with stupid Windows IE
	which caches URL in the craziest of ways.

2003-09-28 16:48  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_FloatNumber_Field.php: Overrode getValue() to return
	an actual float. (Cast)

2003-09-27 18:48  patrick

	if you want the window unregistered.

2003-09-27 18:33  patrick

	false for the insertAction, the handler will not set the action.

2003-09-27 16:48  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_Image_Upload_Field.php: If the thumbnail cannot read
	the original image, set the dimensions to ??x??, and create an
	image that says "no thumbnail". We also call imagedestroy() on the
	images created to free up memory. Apparently, this is *VERY*
	important to do, as the memory may never free up.

2003-09-27 14:47  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_AutoSubmit_Select_Field.php: Added $omitGoButton
	option to the constructor so you have an autosubmit field that
	doesn't have a button. When omitted, the javascript submits the
	form rather than clicking the button, so you have to look for
	changes in the value in the CC_Application->preprocess() method
	instead (or whatever other mechanism suits you best).

2003-09-23 21:41  jamie

	* CC_Utilities.php: Added error-checking in cc_mail.

2003-09-23 17:32  patrick

2003-09-23 12:55  patrick

	documentation for setSearchButtonDefault() to note that the method
	must be called after the component is registered with the window.

2003-09-21 15:01  jamie

	* CC_Application.php: Changed some comments.

2003-09-18 23:59  patrick

	avoid warnings.

2003-09-18 16:38  jamie

	CC_Framework to N2O for the related images..

2003-09-18 16:35  jamie

	* CC_Fields/CC_Percentage_Field.php: Switch image path from
	CC_Framework to N20.

2003-09-18 15:24  patrick

	* CC_Summary.php: Replaced some printf() calls with echo because
	echo with dot concatenation is faster than printf() with string
	substitution.

2003-09-16 17:39  jamie

	* CC_Fields/CC_ProvinceState_Field.php: Added comments for the
	class member variables.

2003-09-16 17:35  jamie

	* CC_Fields/: CC_Province_Field.php, CC_StateProvinceNA_Field.php,
	CC_StateProvince_Field.php, CC_State_Field.php: Removed redundant
	fields. The new State/Province field has six possible args in the
	argument array: showFirst, NAFirst, abbreviated, includeStates,
	includedProvinces, includeNA. See CC_ProvinceState_Field for
	details and/or CC_Record::createFieldObject().

2003-09-16 17:31  jamie

	* CC_Record.php: Added support for the new State/Province Field
	while keep it backward compatible.

2003-09-16 17:30  jamie

	* CC_Fields/CC_ProvinceState_Field.php: Made an all-encompassing
	Province/State field to minimize on zee overhead.

2003-09-16 14:54  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_Expiry_Date_Field.php: Added getYYMMValue() function
	to return the expiry date in a YYMM format (Moneris uses a
	backwards format for some reason, so maybe other payment gateways
	do too.)

2003-09-16 14:37  patrick

	* CC_Handlers/: CC_Insert_Record_Handler.php,
	CC_Update_Record_Handler.php: Updated handler to have a default
	value for $multipleClick.

2003-09-16 13:49  mike

	ever!

2003-09-16 10:00  jamie

	* CC_Record.php: Added support for case CC_StateProvinceNA_Field.

2003-09-15 23:38  patrick

	now [try to] create it.

2003-09-15 23:38  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_File_Upload_Field.php: Removed some attributes in
	getEditHTML() that didn't exist.

2003-09-15 14:12  patrick

	* CC_RelationshipManager.php: Added addManyRelationship, changed
	constructor to use addXXX() methods.

2003-09-15 13:36  patrick

	file.

2003-09-14 23:21  patrick

	* CC_Window.php: Updated setArgument() and getArgument() to not
	pass by reference -- that's what registerObject() and getObject()
	are for. setArgument() is for primitive types; registerObject() and
	getObject() are for objects.

2003-09-14 18:08  patrick

	* cc_styles.css: Fixed style for file fields.

2003-09-14 16:23  patrick

	* CC_Fields/: CC_File_Upload_Field.php, CC_Image_Upload_Field.php:

2003-09-14 15:49  patrick

	* CC_FieldManager.php: Construct the stdclass as a reference.

2003-09-14 15:45  patrick

	* cc_styles.css: Added styles for the file upload tables

2003-09-14 15:45  patrick

	* CC_Fields/: CC_File_Upload_Field.php, CC_Image_Upload_Field.php,
	CC_Multiple_File_Upload_Field.php: Converted image upload field to
	use GD graphics functions for resizing, etc. No more ImageMagick!

2003-09-14 15:44  patrick

2003-09-14 14:03  patrick

	* CC_Summary_Filters/CC_Id_Link_Filter.php: Added a filter for

	* CC_Windows/CC_View_Record_Window.php: Construct objects with
	references now.

2003-09-14 12:55  patrick

2003-09-13 23:20  jamie

	always being highlit when there were multiple summaries. Added the
	summary name to the row's 'id' value to uniquely identify the row
	to highlite.

2003-09-13 16:22  jamie

	* CC_Handlers/CC_Download_XLS_Handler.php,
	CC_Buttons/CC_Download_Excel_Button.php: Added a standalone
	download Excel button.

	enclosed in quotes.

2003-09-13 15:22  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_File_Upload_Field.php: getIcon() was incorrectly
	referencing /CC_Framework/ instead of /N2O.

2003-09-13 15:21  patrick

	* CC_ErrorManager.php: Corrected N20 to N2O. (zero to oh)

2003-09-13 15:19  patrick

	* CC_Config.php, CC_ErrorManager.php, CC_Index.php: Changed the
	error logging to go use Apache's error logging facilities. Whatever
	ErrorLog is set to in your Apache configuration will be where
	errors go.
	
	Reformatted error messages to match style used by Apache. (Added
	client IP, removed date, removed line break.)
	
	Added block in CC_Config for setting the domain of a cookie. By
	default, cookies are only valid for the virtualhost (ie.
	www.coverallcrew.com), but sometimes you may want your sessions to
	be readable by other sites in the domain. You can use $cookieDomain
	to set your session to be valid by .coverallcrew.com which will
	encompass all coverallcrew.com domains.

2003-09-13 14:15  jamie

	* CC_Field.php: Added a getLabelText method to extract just the raw
	text of the label.

	variables to $ccXXX. Update your apps!!

2003-09-04 12:53  mike

2003-09-04 12:51  mike

	* CC_Handlers/CC_Delete_Folder_File_Handler.php: Removed the
	updateFolder method as the component now automagically updates with
	the 'get' callback method from the parent window.

2003-09-04 12:50  mike

	* CC_Components/CC_Folder_Component.php: Better integrated the
	component into its parent window. Get fields from window when

	method to handle automagically updating.

2003-09-04 11:43  mike

	* CC_Component.php: Added a call-back method called "get" which is
	called from the getComponent method usually found in the else block
	of a window!

2003-09-03 19:42  patrick

	* CC_Index.php: We now look for $session_save_path and call

	CC_Handlers/CC_RemoveFileFromDB_Handler.php,
	CC_Summary_Filters/CC_Reltve_Timestamp_Fltr.php: Changed it so no
	file calls require_once() for another N2O class. This is all done
	inside the big _RequireOnceFiles.php. Why would I go and go this?
	Because when N2O is deployed, all classes get merged into one file,
	and those require_once() lines mess things up if they are referring
	to the individual class files.

2003-09-02 15:06  patrick

	* CC_Components/CC_Query_Additions/CC_Checkbox_Query_Addition.php:

2003-08-28 20:41  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_Dollar_Field.php: Overrode setValue() to round the
	value to two decimal places. Previously, when *displaying* the
	value, the value would be rounded, but internally, a more precise
	number might have been stored.

2003-08-28 20:30  jamie

	* _RequireOnceFiles.php: Requiring some Query Additions, baby.

2003-08-28 20:29  jamie

	* CC_Fields/CC_Date_Field.php: Fixed some errors in the comments.
	Set the default year value range from 1993 to 2013, this is because
	there are many instances where a date is needed before 2003. (10
	years +/- is better than the 2003-2010 it had before.

2003-08-28 12:16  mike

	Search-O-Matic to allow for CC_Query_Addition objects to be
	registered so that another entity may add to the query of a
	CC_Summary.

2003-08-14 13:57  patrick

	* CC_Summary.php, CC_Summary_Content_Provider.php: Modified content
	providers so that they are passed in the entire $row array for the
	current row of the CC_Summary.

2003-08-14 12:33  patrick

	* CC_Fields/: CC_Date_Field.php (version-1), CC_Date_Field.php:
	Added default values for setXXXValue() methods.

2003-08-14 12:23  patrick

	* CC_Fields/: CC_SelectList_Field.php (version-1),
	CC_SelectList_Field.php: Added default value for
	setUnselectedValue().

2003-08-14 12:04  patrick

	* CC_Record.php, CC_Fields/CC_Date_Field.php: Added
	setAllowBlankValue() to the CC_Date_Field so you leave a date field
	blank. (ie. Cancel Date for Retrix Admin)

2003-08-14 11:54  patrick

	* CC_Record.php, CC_Fields/CC_Date_Field.php (version-1): Added
	setAllowBlankValue() to the CC_Date_Field so you leave a date field
	blank. (ie. Cancel Date for Retrix Admin)

2003-08-12 17:05  patrick

	* CC_Buttons/CC_AnchorText_Button.php: Fixed a syntax error.

2003-08-12 17:03  patrick

	* CC_Summary.php: Added getNumRows().

2003-08-11 19:44  patrick

	* CC_Buttons/CC_AnchorText_Button.php: Added a CC_AnchorText_Button
	for doing direct links.

2003-08-11 15:38  patrick

	* CC_Button.php: Fixed a duplicate use of $i in
	setRecordsToValidate().

2003-08-11 14:43  patrick

	* CC_Button.php: Added setRecordsToValidate() to match
	setFieldsToValidate().

2003-08-11 14:13  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_Checkbox_Field.php: Made the label be optional.

2003-08-11 12:30  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_Checkbox_Field.php: Added a default value (0) to
	setValue().

2003-08-10 20:04  patrick

	* CC_Summary.php, CC_Handlers/CC_Summary_Refresh_Handler.php: Added
	a handler to the refresh button that calls update() on the summary
	object.

2003-08-07 16:45  patrick

	* CC_Handlers/CC_Delete_Multiple_Records_Handler.php: Updated
	handler to take into account the new way the $records array works.

2003-08-07 16:45  patrick

	* CC_Handlers/CC_Multiple_Selections_Handler.php: IMPORTANT CHANGE.
	PLEASE READ. The $records array that gets set by this handler now
	stores the entire row from the summary, not just the id. This makes
	it easier to reuse the data that we already have from the parent
	summary rather than having to look it up again.

2003-08-07 11:43  patrick

	* CC_Summary.php: A few changes to reduce the bytes of HTML
	produced with the multiple selection stuff...

2003-08-06 12:17  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_Checkbox_Field.php: For some reason, you have to
	cast the value to a (string) when doing a $value == 't', otherwise
	it will evaluate to true when $value is 0. That's just whacked.

2003-08-04 18:07  patrick

	* CC_Utilities.php: Fixed unsetKeyArray() to work properly. (At
	least, it appears to be working now...)

2003-08-04 16:13  patrick

	* CC_Handlers/CC_Summary_Search_Handler.php: Fixed a bug when
	detecting a "where" clause.

2003-08-01 16:27  patrick

	* CC_Handlers/CC_Multiple_Selections_Handler.php: Made process()
	pay attention to the $idColumn variable in the CC_Summary, as well
	as look for a lowercase version of the id.

2003-08-01 16:09  patrick

	* CC_Summary.php: Changed the name of some multiple checkbox
	fields.

2003-08-01 16:09  patrick

	a bit in process() (reduced the number of variables).

2003-08-01 15:59  patrick

	* CC_Handlers/CC_Multiple_Selections_Handler.php: Set default
	values for the constructor parameters so you don't have to specify
	them.

2003-08-01 15:58  patrick

	* CC_Summary.php: Improved addMultipleSelectionsButton() to
	automatically set the summary's name and main table on the handler
	that gets passed in.

2003-08-01 15:48  patrick

	* CC_Summary.php: More variable initialization before use, removed
	some debug code from the JavaScript (compare revisions if you need
	it again).

2003-08-01 15:46  patrick

	* CC_Summary.php: Initialized $html in
	getIncludeMultipleSelectionsHTML() before using it.

2003-08-01 10:44  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_Expiry_Date_Field.php: Fixed validation to allow
	current month.

2003-08-01 10:43  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_Expiry_Date_Field.php (version-1): Fixed expiry date
	to allow for the current month.

2003-07-31 15:19  patrick

	* CC_Index.php: Switched N2O to only look in $_GET for the
	session_id(), as it already looks in other places, and it's the
	$_GET one that we really care about.

2003-07-31 14:55  patrick

	* CC_Index.php: Added the ability for N2O to recognize an existing
	session_id in the URL when starting a new session. The was needed
	if something else actually started the session, and then forwarded
	a browser there (ie. FatPoint).

2003-07-30 20:34  patrick

	* CC_Handlers/CC_Summary_Search_Handler.php: Fixed a syntax error.

2003-07-30 15:07  patrick

	* CC_Handlers/CC_Summary_Search_Handler.php: Improved query parsing
	to detect a previous "where" clause.

2003-07-29 12:34  mike

	* CC_Record.php: Added a check for 't' for postgres boolean (for
	checkbox field)

2003-07-29 12:11  mike

	* CC_Fields/CC_Checkbox_Field.php: Fixed the variable name!!! Me
	Speelin' is baad.

2003-07-29 12:04  mike

	* CC_Fields/CC_Checkbox_Field.php: Added check for 't' in the
	contructor.

2003-07-29 11:56  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_Phone_Field.php: Changed the default size to 32
	instead of 30 so that it's consistent with everything else.

2003-07-29 11:56  patrick

	* CC_Record.php: Construct the phone field the same way as the text
	field.

2003-07-29 11:55  mike

	* CC_Fields/CC_Checkbox_Field.php: Added postgres support... or did
	I?

2003-07-28 15:53  patrick

	* CC_Button.php: Removed some commented out code that wasn't
	needed.

2003-07-28 15:52  patrick

	* CC_Button.php: Also replace # if found in the button label when
	creating the button id..

2003-07-28 10:34  patrick

	* CC_Components/CC_Summary_Search_Component.php: Changed
	'Search-o-Matic' to 'Search-O-Matic'.

	Added the use of a ccDisabled style for disabled buttons.

	do not exist.

	* CC_Index.php: Improved handling when a button is not registered
	with window.

2003-07-24 11:19  mike

	* CC_Summary.php: setAddHandler takes a CC_Action_Handler argument,
	not a string (docs  wrong)

2003-07-22 16:13  patrick

	* CC_Index.php: Pass in $button->getPath() into the
	getFormAction().

2003-07-22 15:45  mike

	* CC_Summaries/CC_Safe_Summary.php: Simplified the code.

2003-07-22 15:40  mike

	* CC_Summaries/CC_Safe_Summary.php: Fixed the commenting of the
	private variables.

2003-07-22 12:38  patrick

	* CC_Summary.php: Expanded on an error message that happens when
	you use the group by clause in a CC_Summary.

2003-07-22 11:57  patrick

	* CC_Summary.php: Fixed setIdColumn() to not call a deprecated
	method.

2003-07-22 11:46  mike

	* CC_Summaries/CC_Safe_Summary.php: Moved the group and where
	clauses up in the code so they can be appended (grrrr).

2003-07-22 11:39  patrick

	* CC_FieldManager.php: Made the $argString be an optional parameter
	in addField().

2003-07-22 11:36  patrick

	* CC_Summary.php: Added setIdColumn() so that you can use a
	CC_Summary on a table that doesn't have an "ID" column.

2003-07-22 11:26  mike

	* CC_Summaries/CC_Safe_Summary.php: Added two private variables
	_whereClause and _groupClause, if you set these, they will be
	appended to the query in the update method.

2003-07-22 11:20  patrick

	* CC_ErrorManager.php: Removed some debug output that accidentally
	got left in.

2003-07-22 10:28  mike

	* CC_Summaries/CC_Safe_Summary.php: Fixed the appended query.

2003-07-22 10:24  patrick

	* CC_ErrorManager.php: Fixed a problem where an application error
	would call cc_die() before logging the output. Made it difficult to
	know why the problem happened.

2003-07-22 10:21  mike

	* CC_Summaries/CC_Safe_Summary.php: Removed duplicate code.

2003-07-22 10:20  mike

	* CC_Summaries/CC_Safe_Summary.php: Removed Ordering from select
	statement to gather number of records.

2003-07-22 10:09  mike

	* CC_Summaries/CC_Safe_Summary.php: Added a space to the appended
	query to avoid parse error.

2003-07-22 00:54  patrick

	* CC_Summary.php: Fixed a bug in getSummaryControlRow().

2003-07-21 16:50  mike

	* CC_Summaries/CC_Safe_Summary.php: Removed the 'limit' from the
	query to gather number of results.

2003-07-21 16:35  mike

	* CC_Summaries/CC_Safe_Summary.php: CC_Safe_Summary for your safe
	summary needs!

2003-07-21 16:34  patrick

	* CC_Summary.php: Whoops, I mean SORT_NUMERIC.

2003-07-21 16:33  patrick

	* CC_Summary.php: Fixed setDefaultNumRowsPerPage() so "All" is no
	longer in the middle. It need to be sorted using the SORT_STRING
	type.

2003-07-21 16:32  mike

	* CC_Database.php: Added cc_num_rows method.

2003-07-21 16:22  patrick

	* CC_Summary.php: Fixed getSummaryControlRol() to compare
	$numRecords to the value of the number of rows per page select list
	rather than the default num rows per page.

2003-07-21 15:01  patrick

	* CC_Database.php: doSelect(), doUpdate(), and doInsert() now
	output the queries to the error.log file when in debug mode.

2003-07-21 11:12  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_SelectList_Field.php: Added setJavascriptOnChange()
	method so you can add javascript to the onChange handler. Also made
	the field use the style it's assigned.

2003-07-21 11:11  patrick

	* CC_Application.php, CC_Config.php, CC_FieldManager.php: Added
	support so that you can have CC_Framework not lookup information in
	the CC_FIELDS table, but still have database access turned on.

2003-07-18 17:29  patrick

	* CC_Handlers/CC_Summary_Sort_Handler.php: Sort handler now calls
	update() on the summary.

2003-07-18 17:27  patrick

	* CC_Application.php, CC_Index.php,
	CC_Buttons/CC_AnchorImage_Button.php,
	CC_Buttons/CC_Sort_Button.php, CC_Buttons/CC_Text_Button.php:
	Another fix to getFormAction() to take the button's getPath() into
	account.

2003-07-18 17:16  patrick

	* CC_Buttons/CC_Sort_Button.php: Fixed a syntax error.

2003-07-18 17:14  patrick

	* CC_Handlers/: CC_Summary_JumpPage_Handler.php,
	CC_Summary_Next_Handler.php, CC_Summary_Num_Rows_Handler.php,
	CC_Summary_Previous_Handler.php, CC_Summary_Reorder_Handler.php,
	CC_Summary_Sort_Handler.php: The handlers for the summary buttons
	now do an update on the summary.
	
	TODO: make update() smart enough not to do an update if the last
	update was done in the last 2 or 3 seconds (which would be the case
	if your handler does and update, and you have
	$window->getSummary('summary', true)).

2003-07-18 17:13  patrick

	* CC_Application.php, CC_Buttons/CC_AnchorImage_Button.php,
	CC_Buttons/CC_Sort_Button.php, CC_Buttons/CC_Text_Button.php:
	getFormAction() now accepts a query string argument, the anchor
	buttons now get their target link from getFormAction().

2003-07-18 15:51  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_RadioButton_Field.php: Refixed a problem that I
	already fixed! Damn CVS! (Initialized $radioHTML before using it in
	getEditHTML().)

2003-07-17 13:13  patrick

	* CC_Summary.php: Deferred the first call to update() to happen
	when the component is registered rather than doing it in the
	constructor. This will allow you to make calls to change the number
	of rows per page, etc. after constructing without having
	unnecessary calls to the database. Also moved the registration of
	sub-components in the constructor to the register() method where it
	belongs.

2003-07-16 14:20  patrick

	* CC_Components/CC_Summary_Search_Component.php: Added
	setSearchButtonDefault() to make the search button be the default
	button in a window.

2003-07-16 01:09  jamie

	* CC_Application.php, CC_Button.php, CC_Component.php,
	CC_Field.php, CC_Summary.php, CC_Summary_Content_Provider.php,
	CC_Buttons/CC_AnchorImage_Button.php,
	CC_Buttons/CC_Cancel_Button.php, CC_Buttons/CC_Image_Button.php,

	CC_Fields/CC_RadioButton_Field.php,
	CC_Fields/CC_Related_Table_Field.php,
	CC_Fields/CC_SelectList_Field.php,
	CC_Summaries/CC_Ordered_Summary.php,
	CC_Summary_Content_Providers/CC_OneToMany_Check_Provider.php:
	Finished commenting stage 1 of all files. Let the revisions begin.
	If you see something that isn't clear, feel free to change it using
	the guidelines in http://coverallcrew.com/extranet/. Also don't
	forget to add comments to *all* new classes and files per the same
	guidlines. Rock on!

2003-07-15 17:13  mike

	* CC_Record.php: No wonder it didn't work! When you use a variable
	that doesn't exist things don't like to cooperate!

2003-07-15 16:59  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_RadioButton_Field.php: setSelectedAtIndex() now also
	checks to make sure the passed in index isn't greater than or equal
	to the size of the array.

2003-07-15 15:01  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_RadioButton_Field.php: If setSelectedIndex()
	receives a blank index, set it to zero and trigger a warning.

2003-07-15 14:38  mike

	* CC_Record.php: Only convert the first 18 characters of the date
	for postgres. (for the cc_datetime_field case)

2003-07-15 13:27  mike

	* CC_Record.php: Made 'ID' column name a variable so we can support
	databases that don't use 'ID' as the default ID.

2003-07-15 13:08  mike

	* CC_Summary.php: Set documenation to link to handler class for
	setViewHandler.

2003-07-15 13:05  mike

	* CC_Summary.php: Added note to setViewHandler method.

2003-07-15 12:53  patrick

	* CC_Summary_Filters/CC_DateTime_Filter.php: Only convert the first
	18 characters of the date, as anything else shouldn't be there.
	Postgres for some reason has more characters, and it would just be
	problematic.

2003-07-15 12:01  patrick

	* CC_Components/CC_Summary_Search_Component.php: Renamed label of
	search field to "Search-o-Matic".

2003-07-15 10:16  patrick

	* CC_Handlers/CC_Summary_Search_Handler.php: Damn typos!

2003-07-15 10:14  patrick

	* CC_Handlers/CC_Summary_Search_Handler.php: Fixed the way we
	detect which database is being used.

2003-07-15 10:13  patrick

	* CC_Database.php: Added isPostgres() and isMysql() methods to
	detect the database type.

2003-07-15 10:05  patrick

	* CC_Components/CC_Summary_Search_Component.php,
	CC_Handlers/CC_Summary_ClearSearch_Handler.php,
	CC_Handlers/CC_Summary_Search_Handler.php: Implemented the
	functionality of the clear button.

2003-07-15 09:49  patrick

	* CC_Summary_Filters/CC_Alignment_Filter.php: Added alignment
	filter so you can set the alignment on a column.

2003-07-14 22:36  patrick

	* _RequireOnceFiles.php,
	CC_Components/CC_Summary_Search_Component.php,
	CC_Handlers/CC_Summary_Search_Handler.php: Added a new search
	component! Woo-hoo!
	
	See the sample app for an example of it in action.

2003-07-14 22:31  jamie

	* CC_Fields/: CC_File_Upload_To_DB_Field.php,
	CC_Image_Upload_To_DB_Field.php: These are no longer used anywhere.

2003-07-14 21:47  patrick

	* CC_Button.php, CC_Component.php, CC_Field.php, CC_Record.php,
	CC_Summary.php, CC_Window.php: Changed
	CC_Window->registerComponent() to do a call-back on a new
	register() method in the CC_Component class. Now each component
	itselfs calls the appropriate registerXXXX() method in CC_Window.
	
	Why is this good? I thought you'd never ask! :) We can now make our
	own custom components that consist of sub-components. When the
	sub-component gets registered, it can register its sub-components
	(fields, buttons, etc.) with the window so that they will function
	properly. Custom components will then have to register themselves
	using registerCustomComponent(). The custom component can be
	retrieved using getComponent(). (All CC_Components have a setName()
	and getName(), and that will be the key to use with getComponent().
	
	The first use of this new feature will be a simple search component
	for a CC_Summary.

2003-07-14 21:39  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_AutoSubmit_Select_Field.php: Improved the
	constructor to work when you construct an autosubmit field in the
	constructor of an application (before the $application super-global
	is available).

2003-07-14 21:37  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_Checkbox_Field.php: Improved the way <span> tags
	were being added to the label and component. Specifically, I made
	it so it doesn't add a <span> tag if there is no style.

2003-07-14 21:36  patrick

	* CC_Index.php, CC_Application.php: Added getFormPath() to
	CC_Application so that you can dynamically change the path to which
	the form posts. This is useful where you're using the Apache
	<Location> tag magic to make use of the PATH_INFO variable.

2003-07-14 01:48  jamie

	* CC_Fields/: CC_AutoSubmit_Select_Field.php, CC_Country_Field.php,
	CC_Credit_Card_Field.php, CC_DateTime_Field.php,
	CC_Date_Added_Field.php, CC_Date_Field.php, CC_Dollar_Field.php,
	CC_Domain_Field.php, CC_Email_Field.php, CC_Expiry_Date_Field.php,

	CC_Number_Field.php, CC_Password_Field.php, CC_Phone_Field.php,
	CC_PostalCode_Field.php, CC_PostalZipCode_Field.php,
	CC_ProvinceState_Field.php, CC_Province_Field.php,
	CC_SelectList_Field.php, CC_State_Field.php, CC_TextArea_Field.php,
	CC_Text_Field.php, CC_Time_Field.php, CC_Timestamp_Field.php,
	CC_Username_Field.php, CC_ZipCode_Field.php: Commented these
	CC_Fields.

2003-07-11 15:11  mike

	* CC_Fields/CC_RadioButton.php: Fixed the contructor to add the
	index!

2003-07-11 15:07  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_RadioButton_Field.php: Define $radioHTML in
	getEditHTML() before appending to it.

2003-07-11 14:59  patrick

	* CC_ErrorManager.php: Added a better check for $showErrorsOfType
	on line 8. (Used isset()).

2003-07-11 14:31  mike

	* CC_Record.php: Made sure parameter2 exists for
	cc_radiobutton_field case.

2003-07-11 14:18  mike

	* CC_Record.php: Missed a crutial part in setting the selected
	index. :)

2003-07-11 14:14  mike

	* CC_Record.php: Fixed cc_radiobutton_field case to properly set
	the index of the default value.

2003-07-08 13:18  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_Checkbox_Field.php: Added documentation for the
	validate() function to indicate on what criteria it validates. This
	needs to be done for each field that does its own validation.

2003-07-08 13:14  patrick

	* CC_Field.php: Made getEditHTML() and getViewHTML() private. This
	needs to be done for every single field that overrides the parent.

2003-07-07 16:39  patrick

	* CC_Handlers/CC_Insert_FK_Record_Handler.php: Removed a stray "s"
	at the beginning of the file. This should have been caught in the
	standard "sample" application test.

2003-07-07 14:03  patrick

	* CC_Field.php: Only return something in getErrorMessageDisplay()
	if there is an error.

2003-07-06 22:18  jamie

	* CC_Action_Handler.php: I changed the package name to conform.

2003-07-06 22:13  jamie

	* CC_Handlers/: CC_100_PercentFieldHandler.php,
	CC_AddFileUploadField_Handler.php, CC_Add_FK_Record_Handler.php,

2003-07-05 18:31  jamie

	* CC_Summary_Filters/: CC_DateTime_Filter.php, CC_Date_Filter.php,
	CC_Dollar_Filter.php, CC_LineBreak_Filter.php, CC_Month_Filter.php,
	CC_NoBreak_Filter.php, CC_Percentage_Filter.php,

	CC_Short_Date_Filter.php, CC_Text_Shortening_Filter.php,
	CC_Timestamp_Filter.php, CC_TrueFalseYesNo_Filter.php: Added
	comments to the CC_Summary_Filters

2003-07-04 11:58  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_Checkbox_Field.php: Added a validate method so that
	if a checkbox is required and isn't checked, it will return false.

2003-07-04 11:57  patrick

	* CC_Field.php: Added isRequired() method to check if a field is
	required.

2003-07-03 11:51  mike

	* CC_Database.php: Fixed gramatical error in description

2003-07-02 11:47  patrick

	* CC_Fields/: CC_Credit_Card_Field.php (version-1),
	CC_Credit_Card_Field.php: We now do a strSlide13() on the
	$defaultValue before passing it into the super-constructor.

2003-07-02 11:36  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_Credit_Card_Field.php (version-1): We needed to call
	setValue() in the constructor.

2003-07-01 16:48  patrick

	* CC_ErrorManager.php: $verboseError on line 67 was using a .=
	operator, but it did not exist prior to that line.

2003-07-01 01:00  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_RadioButton_Field.php: Added a getSize() method to
	return the number of radio buttons inside this field.

2003-06-29 14:01  mike

	* CC_Fields/CC_RadioButton.php: Modified the javascript code for
	radiobuttons when only one radiobutton is in a group.

2003-06-29 10:06  jamie

	* CC_Database.php: fixed the @see comments to be comma separated
	instead of 'and' separated

2003-06-28 16:25  jamie

	* CC_Record.php, CC_Summary.php, CC_Summary_Content_Provider.php,
	CC_Summary_Filter.php, CC_Utilities.php: Top level commenting
	complete...

2003-06-28 13:40  patrick

	* CC_Summary.php: Someone checked this in with a conflict
	<<<<<<<<<<<< and >>>>>>>>>>> stuff! Clearly, they did not follow
	procedure by testing with the sample app locally, and then on by
	deploying on Strongbad, which will output any compilation errors
	during the encoding process. Rules, people, rules!

2003-06-28 13:35  patrick

	* CC_Database.php: Added missing comments, changed access levels
	for constructor, openDatabase(), and closeDatabase() to private.

2003-06-28 13:10  jamie

	* CC_Database.php, CC_Download_Source.php, CC_ErrorManager.php,
	CC_FieldManager.php, CC_Image_Source.php,
	CC_RelationshipManager.php, CC_Summary.php,
	CC_Summary_Content_Provider.php, CC_Summary_Filter.php,
	CC_URL_Redirect.php, CC_ZIP_File.php: Top level comments pretty
	much done... CC_Summary is still incomplete and MIKE, please look
	at CC_Database and check my comments... some are incomplete and
	some  are my best guesses without doing more research.

2003-06-27 22:01  jamie

	* CC_User.php, CC_Utilities.php: I added comments galore!!

2003-06-27 18:16  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_RadioButton.php: Returning true now.

2003-06-27 16:45  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_Checkbox_Field.php: Removed the "javascript:"
	because it's implied. It's only needed in an <a href=""> tag.

2003-06-27 16:44  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_RadioButton.php: If the label is clickable, the
	onClickAction also needs to be executed. Also, removed the
	"javascript:", as it's implied in the onClick() handler.

2003-06-27 16:37  patrick

	* CC_Fields/: CC_RadioButton.php, CC_RadioButton_Field.php:
	Restored the constructor of CC_RadioButton to what it used to be,
	made setting the index automatic.

2003-06-27 14:29  jamie

	* CC_FieldManager.php, CC_RelationshipManager.php: Added package
	name and access level...

2003-06-27 14:23  jamie

	* CC_FieldManager.php, CC_RelationshipManager.php: Every day in
	every way I am commenting more and more.

2003-06-27 14:00  mike

	* cc_styles.css: cursor: hand is actually the microsoft way of
	doing things, cursor: pointer is the W3C way of doing things.
	Explorer 6 and later (and mac version) now support cursor: pointer
	for the hand cursor.

2003-06-27 13:54  mike

	* CC_Fields/CC_RadioButton.php: used ccClickableLabel for style
	class

2003-06-27 13:53  mike

	* cc_styles.css: added ccClickableLabel class

2003-06-27 13:53  mike

	* CC_Fields/CC_Checkbox_Field.php: used ccClickableLabel class
	rather than having the style in there.

2003-06-27 13:48  mike

	* CC_Fields/: CC_Checkbox_Field.php, CC_RadioButton.php: fix for
	netscape for the cursor hand

2003-06-27 13:35  mike

	* CC_Fields/: CC_RadioButton.php, CC_Checkbox_Field.php: don't
	switch to the "text selector mouse cursor" when moving over the
	label with the mouse.

2003-06-27 13:26  mike

	* CC_Fields/: CC_RadioButton_Field.php, CC_RadioButton.php: Label
	is now clickable to set radio button checked. Used reference to
	parent to get name of group rather than passing it in method. Each
	radioButton now contains which index it is at.

2003-06-27 12:09  mike

	* CC_Fields/CC_Checkbox_Field.php: Made the checkbox label
	clickable to swap the checkbox field. Also changed several if/else
	blocks into single ternary dingles.

2003-06-27 11:32  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_RadioButton_Field.php: Overrode hasValue() to work
	properly with the radio buttons.

2003-06-26 23:14  patrick

	* CC_Index.php (version-1): Applied the same cache-control header
	as N2O.

2003-06-26 18:58  patrick

	* CC_Index.php: Trying desperately to avoid caching problems in IE!

2003-06-26 18:58  patrick

	* CC_Window.php: Return false on an error in getButtonById().

2003-06-26 18:50  patrick

	* CC_Index.php: Avoid a member call on non-object when a button is
	not found in a window.

2003-06-26 18:44  patrick

	* CC_Index.php: Helps if you close parentheses.

2003-06-26 18:43  patrick

	* CC_Index.php: If there's a lingering ?_LL= in the URL because a
	session timed out, clear the URL.

2003-06-26 18:41  patrick

	* CC_Index.php: Potentially sealed a hole that would cause a
	non-existent button to be execute if the session had timed out, but
	the user had posted old button click data.

2003-06-26 17:44  patrick

	* CC_Application.php, CC_Button.php, CC_ErrorManager.php,
	CC_FieldManager.php, CC_Index.php, CC_Record.php, CC_Window.php,
	CC_Buttons/CC_Image_Button.php,
	CC_Fields/CC_AutoSubmit_Select_Field.php,
	CC_Fields/CC_Credit_Card_Field.php, CC_Fields/CC_Date_Field.php,
	CC_Fields/CC_Foreign_Key_Field.php,

	CC_Fields/CC_RadioButton_Field.php,
	CC_Fields/CC_SelectList_Field.php,
	CC_Windows/CC_Manage_FK_Table_Window.php: Optimized most for
	statements to calculate the sizeof() outside of the for loop.
	Otherwise, a value that doesn't change gets calculated for each
	iteration.

2003-06-26 16:51  patrick

	* CC_Button.php, CC_Buttons/CC_Text_Button.php: Moved the redirect
	path stuff into CC_Button.

2003-06-26 16:22  patrick

	* CC_Application.php: Fixed a syntax error in getWindow().

2003-06-26 16:21  patrick

	* CC_Application.php: Added a warning if you get a window using
	getWindow() that doesn't exist.

2003-06-26 15:03  patrick

	* CC_Button.php: Updated the comments for $action to confirm that
	is still being used.

2003-06-26 14:47  patrick

	* CC_Window.php (version-1), CC_Window.php: Took the strSlide13()
	out of the update for credit card fields.

2003-06-26 14:46  patrick

	* CC_Fields/: CC_Credit_Card_Field.php, CC_Credit_Card_Field.php
	(version-1), CC_Credit_Card_Field.php: Moved all the
	strSlide13()ing into this field. Before, some of it was doing it in
	the CC_Window, and some in the field. Makes it difficult if you're
	manually setting the value.

2003-06-26 14:40  patrick

	* CC_Fields/: CC_Credit_Card_Field.php (version-1),
	CC_Credit_Card_Field.php: Made the error messages better.

2003-06-26 14:33  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_Credit_Card_Field.php: Added more verbose error
	messages.

2003-06-26 14:15  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_Credit_Card_Field.php (version-1): Validate was not
	working! It was getting the value via getValue(), but not undoing
	the strslide13().

2003-06-26 14:13  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_Credit_Card_Field.php: Validating on credit cards
	was broken. [gulp!]

2003-06-26 00:37  patrick

	* CC_Button.php: Handlers now receive a reference to the button
	that is activating them. This way, handlers can manipulate the
	button.

2003-06-25 22:43  patrick

	* CC_Buttons/CC_Text_Button.php: You can now construct a
	CC_Text_Button in the constructor of your application. Woo hoo!

2003-06-25 22:42  patrick

	* CC_Buttons/CC_AnchorImage_Button.php: Added
	CC_AnchorImage_Button. It's like a CC_Image_Button, but it's <a
	href=""><img src=""></a> instead of <input type="image" src="">.

2003-06-25 22:20  patrick

	* CC_Window.php: Start the _tabIndexCounter at 0. (Well, 1,
	really.)

2003-06-25 21:53  patrick

	* CC_Button.php, CC_Window.php, CC_Buttons/CC_Image_Button.php:
	Added support for tab index.

2003-06-25 21:24  patrick

	getEditHTML().

2003-06-25 00:58  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_Password_Field.php: Converted single quotes to
	double.

2003-06-24 22:38  patrick

	* CC_Field.php: Removed a warning message in getRecordKey(), as
	it's okay for a field to not be in a record.

2003-06-24 17:12  patrick

	* CC_Buttons/CC_Text_Button.php: The link should include BASE_URL,
	and now it does.

2003-06-24 15:04  jamie

	* CC_ErrorManager.php, CC_Application.php, CC_Component.php,
	CC_Error.php, CC_Record.php, CC_Window.php: changed package from
	CC_Main to N2O

2003-06-24 11:13  patrick

	* CC_Summary.php: Deprecated setIncludeAddButton(). Use
	setAllowAdd() instead. Fixed the dynamic row colour changing on
	mouse overs and outs. Now works with Safari!

2003-06-24 10:41  jamie

	* CC_Field.php: fixed a tarp-o

2003-06-24 10:36  jamie

	* CC_Error.php, CC_ErrorManager.php, CC_Field.php, CC_Record.php:
	Commenting the beast of beasts... more to come (yeah, baby!)

2003-06-24 10:34  jamie

	* CC_Index.php: moved the exit(0) from
	CC_ErrorManager::displayApplicationErrors() to CC_Index

2003-06-23 16:29  patrick

	* CC_Index.php: Added a call to $button->getPath() in the Location:
	redirect for linkityLacks.

2003-06-23 16:29  patrick

	* CC_Buttons/CC_Text_Button.php: Added getPath() and setPath() so
	you can optionally redirect a text button link to an extended path.

2003-06-23 15:59  patrick

	* CC_Index.php: Trying some new session_cache_limiter() settings
	that may help with IE for Windows.

2003-06-23 01:12  patrick

	* CC_Window.php: Fixed a bug in updateFieldsFromPage() where the
	fieldArraySize was being unset() prematurely.

2003-06-22 16:52  patrick

	* CC_Window.php: Changed the trigger_error() in the constructor to
	be of type E_USER_NOTICE.

2003-06-22 16:51  patrick

	* CC_Record.php: Fixed a call on line 164. It was calling
	$application->isArgument() instead of argumentExists().

2003-06-22 16:41  patrick

	* CC_ErrorManager.php: Changed the default error reporting to be
	E_ALL ^ E_NOTICE, which is PHP's default.

2003-06-22 16:07  patrick

	* CC_Windows/CC_Manage_FK_Table_Window.php (version-1): Set table
	to use ccTable as style.

2003-06-22 03:00  patrick

	* CC_Index.php, CC_Window.php: Moved the error resetting into
	CC_Index where it will happen unconditionally. I noticed that if
	you just did a refresh (GET) on page with an error (something that
	happens each time), the error would be repeated each to you did a
	refresh. (This is because on such a GET refresh,
	CC_Window->updateFieldsFromPage() is not called, so the errors are
	not cleared.)

2003-06-22 01:49  mike

	* CC_Window.php: added getRecordAtIndex method.

2003-06-22 01:47  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_Expiry_Date_Field.php: Fixed the expiry date field
	to default to the next month.

2003-06-22 01:41  patrick

	* CC_Record.php: Changed the cc_expiry_date_field back to +1 month
	now that I realized the expiry field on the connect.fatport.com
	join page wasn't been constructed through a record.

2003-06-21 11:16  jamie

	* CC_Window.php: Commented the CC_Window

2003-06-20 17:35  jamie

	* CC_ErrorManager.php: reversed the fatal and display parameters in
	_addError

2003-06-20 17:28  jamie

	* CC_Window.php: updated the application error methods with the
	proper methods. CC_Window is NOT documented properly yet... I will
	work on it next so the ugly tags are removed AASAP!!
	
	Incremental checkins here we are!! `

2003-06-20 17:18  jamie

	* CC_Button.php: changed setFieldToUpdateArray to the proper
	setFieldsToValidateArray

2003-06-20 16:57  jamie

	* CC_Application.php, CC_Error.php, CC_ErrorManager.php,
	CC_Index.php: removed redundant CC_ErrorManager methods from
	CC_Application and updated relevant files to reflect the change...
	also documented error classes

2003-06-20 00:51  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_Phone_Field.php: Corrected a typo for the
	$numberCount variable.

2003-06-20 00:20  patrick

	* CC_Application.php: For some reason, addApplicationError(),
	addUserError(), and addFieldError() were removed. This broke things
	in the error manager.

2003-06-20 00:10  patrick

	* CC_Application.php: Someone checked this in with a <<<<<<<<<<<<<<
	CC_Application.php line, which doesn't compile.

2003-06-20 00:07  patrick

	* CC_Window.php: We no longer set the date value for
	cc_expiry_date_field.

2003-06-19 20:48  patrick

	* CC_Record.php: Added support for the CC_ISO_Country_Field.

2003-06-19 20:48  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_ISO_Country_Field.php: Added a country select list
	where all the values are the two-letter ISO country codes.

2003-06-19 15:10  jamie

	* CC_Action_Handler.php, CC_Application.php, CC_Button.php,
	CC_Component.php: documenting the beast... please look at how the
	tags are done and start adding the same format to any new methods

2003-06-19 12:40  patrick

	* CC_Window.php: Fixed updateFieldsFromPage() to also work properly
	with fields in records.

2003-06-19 11:27  patrick

	* CC_Button.php: I forgot to update the actual function name for
	setFieldsToValidate().

2003-06-19 11:25  patrick

	* CC_Window.php: Fixed a missing semicolon on line 87.

2003-06-19 11:03  patrick

	* CC_Index.php: Updated button updating as per changes to CC_Window
	and CC_Button.

2003-06-19 11:01  patrick

	* CC_Window.php: Updated logic to use the fieldsToValidateArray for
	validation, not updating. All fields should be updated.

2003-06-19 11:01  patrick

	* CC_Button.php: Deprecated setFieldsToUpdate() and added
	setFieldsToValidate().

2003-06-18 17:08  patrick

	* CC_Application.php: Fixed a missing $ in setLoggedIn().

2003-06-18 16:42  patrick

	* ChangeLog: Updated the ChangeLog to be current.

2003-06-18 16:40  patrick

	* CC_Record.php: Updated the construction of the credit card expiry
	date field so that it is a month in the future. (not sure why it
	wasn't working before...)

2003-06-17 11:43  patrick

	* CC_Application.php: Added setLoggedIn() and isLoggedIn(). Removed
	a $test = 0 variable -- if something breaks for someone and they
	were using this $test variable, this would be why.

2003-06-17 11:04  mike

	* CC_Fields/CC_RadioButton_Field.php: removed the setStyle method,
	is was commented out and just taking up precious bit n' bytes.

2003-06-17 10:53  mike

	* CC_Fields/CC_RadioButton_Field.php: modified the addRadioButton
	method. no longer using using the value to set the key of the radio
	button array, rather i'm just inserting the button at the next
	index.	(I don't know if this will effect anything, anybody know?)

2003-06-17 10:45  mike

	* CC_Fields/CC_RadioButton.php: a type... sort of... more of a
	syntax error... seperated $recordKey$groupname like $recordKey .
	$groupName

	* CC_Application.php: Renamed $userObject to $_user.

2003-06-16 21:39  patrick

	* CC_Window.php: Put the checkbox stuff back to the way it was
	(both are okay, this is preferred).

2003-06-16 21:35  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_Checkbox_Field.php: A missing quotation mark was
	causing some serious troubles!

2003-06-16 21:25  patrick

	* CC_Window.php: Fixed the way the checkbox was being set.

2003-06-16 12:06  patrick

	* CC_Fields/: CC_Credit_Card_Field.php, CC_Email_Field.php,

	needed.

2003-06-15 14:25  patrick

	single, put CVS Id tag in an HTML comment so you can see which file
	is being used.

2003-06-15 14:02  patrick

	* CC_Windows/CC_Manage_FK_Table_Window.php: Fixed the CC_Summary
	constructor. (Removed the $window passing.)

2003-06-15 13:51  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_Checkbox_Field.php: Converted double quotes to
	single.

2003-06-14 19:15  jamie

	error message types to CC_Field and changed updateFieldFromPage in
	CC_Window accordingly...

2003-06-14 18:48  patrick

2003-06-14 18:46  patrick

	* CC_Application.php: Added a preProcess() method that gets called
	at the beginning of a request. You can override this method and use
	it to do things like process $_SERVER['PATH_INFO'].

2003-06-14 17:22  patrick

	* CC_Config.php, CC_Index.php: Added support for overriding the
	path to the log file. Set $logPath in CC_Config...

2003-06-14 16:40  patrick

	* CC_FieldManager.php: Someone made $args an array(), but it is
	not! It was an object, and now is properly declared as $args = new
	stdclass;

2003-06-13 18:43  mike

	* CC_Fields/CC_SelectList_Field.php: updated getSelectedIndex()

2003-06-13 18:29  mike

	* CC_Fields/CC_SelectList_Field.php: added a getSelectedIndex
	method to CC_SelectList_Field

2003-06-13 16:33  patrick

	* CC_Field.php: Set _error to true in setXXXXXError().

2003-06-13 16:30  patrick

	* CC_ErrorManager.php: Reverted the constants -- trying to figure
	out why nothing works anymore!!!!!!!!!!!!

2003-06-13 16:11  patrick

	* CC_Field.php: Commented out contents of setInvalidError() -- same
	reason as setMissingError().

2003-06-13 16:04  patrick

	* CC_ErrorManager.php: Line 352 was causing the application to die
	with this message: CC_ErrorManager()->addError(0): The
	EM_APPLICATION_ERROR error array did not exist. During this crutial
	time, we cannot have this! Jamie, please investigate and fix. I
	changed it to a trigger_error.

2003-06-13 16:00  patrick

	* CC_Field.php: Commented out the contents of setMissingError(). It
	is not always desired to set the error message in this regard, and
	there is currently no (apparent) way to turn this off. We need to
	think about this more, and come up with a solution that is more
	flexible.

2003-06-13 15:56  patrick

	* CC_ErrorManager.php: Fixed _clearErrorsOfType(), as it was
	calling cc_die()!

2003-06-13 14:58  jamie

	* CC_ErrorManager.php, CC_Field.php, CC_Window.php: replaced
	setErrorMessage in CC_Window which uses trigger_error

2003-06-13 01:42  jamie

	* CC_Field.php, CC_Window.php, CC_Fields/CC_Credit_Card_Field.php,
	CC_Fields/CC_Email_Field.php, CC_Fields/CC_Password_Field.php: now
	CC_Fields has a setErrorMessage method that gets used in validate()
	or in a handler... renamed some methods and deprecated others...
	nothing should break, though!

2003-06-13 01:33  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_Date_Field.php: Removed undefined $defaultValue from
	constructor.

2003-06-13 01:32  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_Phone_Field.php: Initialized $numberCount before
	using it.

2003-06-13 00:35  patrick

	* CC_Field.php: Fixed the style to be ccError, not fieldError.

2003-06-12 22:59  patrick

	* CC_Field.php: Changed clearError() to set $this->_errorMessage to
	'' rather than unset()ing it.

2003-06-12 22:57  mike

	* CC_Application.php: added popArgument method which gets a
	specific argument and then removes it from the argument list. Very
	handy if I do say so myself.

2003-06-12 14:08  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_RadioButton_Field.php (version-1): setOptions() now
	works properly.

2003-06-12 14:07  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_RadioButton_Field.php: setOptions() now does what
	it's supposed to.

2003-06-12 10:29  patrick

	* CC_RelationshipManager.php (version-1),
	CC_RelationshipManager.php: Fixed getField() so that a space is
	always inserted before the $additionalWhereClause.

2003-06-11 23:56  patrick

	* CC_Field.php: Initialized $labelText before using it in
	getLabel().

2003-06-11 23:04  patrick

	* CC_Window.php: Restored a line which cleared $this->_errorMessage
	at the start of getErrorMessage().

2003-06-11 22:31  patrick

	* CC_Buttons/CC_Text_Button.php: Added a note about a caveat of
	this component. You can't construct a CC_Text_Button in the
	constructor of a CC_Application.

2003-06-11 22:02  patrick

	* CC_Summary.php: Deprecated setIncludeAddButton(). Use
	setAllowAdd() instead. (To be consistent with setAllowView(),
	setAllowEdit(), and setAllowDelete().)

2003-06-11 21:41  patrick

	* CC_Field.php: Fixed a bug in getLabel().

2003-06-11 16:23  mike

	* CC_Record.php: Added a size parameter to cc_password_field

2003-06-11 13:11  patrick

	* CC_Window.php: Changed the way styles were applied a bit in
	getErrorMessage().

2003-06-11 13:08  patrick

	* CC_Field.php: Only add a <span> tag if there's a style to use.

2003-06-11 11:58  mike

	* CC_Record.php: added a parameter to cc_selectlist_field to accept
	a unselectedValue

2003-06-11 10:44  patrick

	* CC_Window.php: Replaced ccDie() calls with trigger_error()
	because _someone_ *cough* *Mike* *cough* took ccDie() out, but
	didn't search for existing calls to it!

2003-06-11 10:43  patrick

	* CC_Summary_Filters/CC_TrueFalseYesNo_Filter.php: Changed
	CC_TrueFalseYesNo_Filter to be compatible with new storage format
	of CC_Checkbox_Fields.

2003-06-11 10:42  patrick

	* CC_FieldManager.php: Changed $application->ccDie() (which no
	longer exists!!) to getFieldData().

2003-06-10 17:31  mike

	* CC_Record.php: set default length of password field to be 16
	(same as default in the constructor)

2003-06-10 16:40  patrick

	* CC_Window.php: Updated getErrorMessage() include the right style.

2003-06-10 16:24  patrick

	* CC_ErrorManager.php: Increased the default error reporting level
	to include parse errors. We should always see parse errors because
	they need to be fixed right away.

2003-06-10 16:01  patrick

	* CC_Button.php: Although I could swear I already checked this in,
	it appears that I didn't. At any rate, setFieldsToUpdate() now
	takes as many CC_Fields you desire rather than a comma-delimited
	list of field names.

2003-06-10 15:54  patrick

	* CC_Windows/: CC_Add_FK_Record_Window.php,
	CC_Add_Ordered_Record_Window.php, CC_Add_Record_Window.php,
	CC_Default_Summary_Window.php, CC_Delete_Confirm_Window.php,
	CC_Delete_Multiple_Confirm_Window.php,
	CC_Delete_Ordered_Confirm_Window.php,
	CC_Edit_Ordered_Record_Window.php, CC_Edit_Record_Window.php,
	CC_Manage_FK_Table_Window.php, CC_OneToMany_Window.php,
	CC_Remove_File_Confirmation_Window.php,
	CC_View_Ordered_Record_Window.php, CC_View_Record_Window.php: We
	now construct all the windows properly, and do a safer check for
	$windowClass.

2003-06-10 01:01  patrick

	* CC_Index.php: Did a better check on the clickCounter.

2003-06-10 01:00  patrick

	* CC_Window.php: Fixed a problem where the $application object was
	being unset before we were (potentially) done with it.

2003-06-10 00:28  mike

	* CC_Utilities.php: due to popular demand, is_a is back in
	CC_Utilities. (we still may use CC_Framework (aka N2O) on php >=
	4.1)

2003-06-10 00:24  mike

	* CC_Utilities.php: removed is_a method because an is_a method is
	already available is 4.2 and greater.

2003-06-10 00:22  mike

	* CC_Utilities.php: removed ccMail, use ccMail instead. No need to
	keep deprecated methods around, lets establish a clean code-base.

2003-06-10 00:21  mike

	* CC_Record.php: removed setEdit, and setRequiredField, use
	setEditable and setRequiredFields instead. No need to keep
	deprecated methods around, lets establish a clean code-base.

2003-06-10 00:20  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_Date_Field.php: Quoted array values.

2003-06-10 00:19  mike

	* CC_Buttons/CC_Text_Button.php: removed setTextLinkStyle. Use
	CC_Component->setStyle() instead. No need to keep deprecated
	methods around, lets establish a clean code-base.

2003-06-10 00:18  mike

	* CC_Application.php: No need to keep deprecated methods around,
	lets establish a clean code-base.

2003-06-10 00:17  patrick

	* CC_RelationshipManager.php: Changed a strlen() to sizeof(), as
	its argument was an array, not a string.

2003-06-10 00:15  mike

	* CC_Field.php: single quotified, and removed setShowAsterix method
	(invalid spelling). No need to keep deprecated methods around, lets
	establish a clean code-base.

2003-06-10 00:01  patrick

	* CC_Index.php: Removed the clickCounter check in $_REQUEST, as it
	broke all text links!!!!

2003-06-09 23:47  patrick

	* CC_Config.php: Added the logging parameters to the *REFERENCE*
	CC_Config.
	
	Note: All new variables should be defined here as a reference for
	others, not only the sample application!

2003-06-09 23:46  patrick

	* CC_ErrorManager.php: Added constants for errors
	(EM_APPLICATION_ERROR, EM_USER_ERROR, EM_FIELD_ERROR).
	
	Added ability to set the default PHP error_reporting() level. See
	N2O/CC_Config.php for example settings of the new variable,
	$showErrorsOfType.

2003-06-09 23:29  patrick

	* CC_FieldManager.php: getDisplayName() now checks for the
	existence of the column name before trying to access it.

2003-06-09 23:28  patrick

	* CC_Summary.php: Properly initialized a few variables before
	returning them.

2003-06-09 23:27  patrick

	* CC_Buttons/CC_Sort_Button.php: We now call the write
	super-constructor.

2003-06-09 19:20  jamie

	* CC_Application.php: changed _addUserError to addUserError..
	oops... typo

2003-06-09 16:24  mike

	* CC_ErrorManager.php: changed "There are no errors... yet!" to
	"There are no errors."

2003-06-09 16:03  patrick

	* CC_ErrorManager.php: Create some output if the error log file
	could not be written to.

2003-06-09 15:06  patrick

	* CC_Window.php: Rather than calculating the size of the
	$fieldArray in every for loop iteration of updateFieldsFromPage(),
	we only calculate it once.

2003-06-09 00:09  jamie

	* CC_Record.php: check the argument list in CC_Fields for
	'summaryLabel' which is the unique label to use for downloading
	full tab-delimited summaries, so there is no ambiguity

2003-06-09 00:01  jamie

	* CC_Window.php: changed the logic for displaying errors... now
	getErrorMessage looks to CC_ErrorManager to get errors,
	specifically 'user' and 'field' errors.

2003-06-08 23:46  jamie

	* _RequireOnceFiles.php: added CC_ErrorManager and CC_Error to the
	list

2003-06-08 23:14  jamie

	* CC_Index.php: added /<app path>/?err page for displaying
	'application' errors... and added some error checking for
	multipleClick and clickCounter

2003-06-08 21:50  jamie

	* CC_Database.php: commented out the persistent stuff because the
	variable didn't exist in the contructor

2003-06-08 21:48  jamie

	* CC_Application.php: mirrored most public functions in
	CC_ErrorManager so you don't have to refer to the ErrorManager
	object every time you want to do error stuff... the same practive
	should be employed for new additions...

2003-06-08 21:44  jamie

	* CC_Field.php: changed the way errors are set here. _addError
	instead of 'setErrorMessage'.. it really only affects where errors
	are added in CC_Window in 'updateFieldFromPage'

2003-06-08 21:18  jamie

	* CC_Fields/: CC_Credit_Card_Field.php, CC_Email_Field.php,
	CC_File_Upload_Field.php, CC_Multiple_File_Upload_ToPath_Field.php,
	CC_Password_Field.php: changed methods for handling errors...
	instead of setErrorMessage there is setError and setInvalidMessage
	see CC_Field for comments

2003-06-08 21:12  jamie

	* CC_Error.php, CC_ErrorManager.php, CC_Error_Log.php: new files
	for managing errors

2003-06-08 21:11  jamie

	* CC_FieldManager.php: added some error checking here based on
	errors returned by the new error reporting system!!

2003-06-08 17:03  jamie

	* CC_Handlers/CC_Redirect_Handler.php: removed typo ($ after ->)

2003-06-08 16:10  patrick

	* CC_Database.php: Fixed CC_Database so it works again.

2003-06-08 15:32  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_Country_Field.php: Converted double quotes to
	single.

2003-06-08 11:27  patrick

	* CC_Database.php: Took some code out of closeDatabase() that
	wasn't supposed to be checked in. openDatabase() was nesting a
	duplicate if block.

2003-06-07 12:41  patrick

	* CC_Database.php, CC_Record.php,
	CC_Fields/CC_Credit_Card_Field.php: CC_Record.php

2003-06-06 19:50  mike

	* CC_Application.php, CC_FieldManager.php: note to self: remember
	to remove debug code before checking in.

2003-06-06 19:46  mike

	* CC_Application.php: added a check for the new variable
	$noDatabase in the constructor. This variable should be created in
	CC_Config.php to indictate whether or not you would like to use
	this application with a database.

2003-06-06 19:44  mike

	* CC_FieldManager.php: added an addField method, also did a check
	in the constructor for a null dbManager.

2003-06-05 12:41  patrick

	* CC_Handlers/CC_Delete_Confirm_Handler.php: Fixed process() to
	work properly when you override getSetActionFuction().

2003-06-05 12:41  patrick

	* CC_Handlers/CC_Delete_Confirm_Handler.php (version-1): Fixed
	process() to work properly when you override
	getSetActionFunction().

2003-06-02 13:49  patrick

	* CC_Field.php: Changed $missingOrInvalid to $_error.

2003-05-30 18:46  patrick

	* CC_Record.php: CC_Record now uses CC_Field->hasError() rather
	than accessing the variable directly.

2003-05-30 18:45  patrick

	* CC_Window.php: Removed some commented out code that will likely
	never get used again.

2003-05-30 18:42  patrick

	* CC_Window.php: Changed updateFieldFromPage() to use setError()
	rather than accessing the $missingOrInvalid variable directly.

2003-05-30 18:40  patrick

	* CC_Field.php: Added hasError() and deprecated getError().

2003-05-26 15:50  patrick

	* CC_Buttons/CC_Image_Button.php: Image Buttons will now pass the x
	and y co-ordinates of the click into the process() method of the
	handler.

2003-05-26 15:08  patrick

	* CC_Utilities.php: Fixed a small bug that caused
	array_change_key_case() to not work.

2003-05-26 14:59  patrick

	* CC_Utilities.php: Created an array_change_key_case() function so
	that N2O will work with PHP < 4.2.0.

2003-05-26 01:08  patrick

	* CC_Buttons/CC_Image_Button.php: Removed a line that wasn't doing
	anything useful.

2003-05-26 01:07  patrick

	* CC_Record.php: Added setShowAsterisk(), fixed a few little things
	like double quotes and such.

2003-05-26 01:05  patrick

	* CC_Button.php, CC_Buttons/CC_Sort_Button.php: Changed double
	quotes to single.

2003-05-26 00:58  patrick

	* CC_Fields/CC_Checkbox_Field.php: Fixed a few things in
	CC_Checkbox_Field to work with the new 1/0 value thing.

2003-05-26 00:54  patrick

	* CC_Window.php: Fixed CC_Window so that CC_Checkbox_Fields get
	updated properly. (Their internal value was changed from
	'true'/'false' to 1/0.)

2003-05-25 23:57  patrick

	* CC_User.php: Added setXXX() functions to match all the getXXX()
	ones.

2003-05-23 15:12  mike

	* CC_Database.php: fixed begin, rollback, and commit methods to use
	PEAR::DB methods

2003-05-22 23:14  patrick

	* CC_Summary.php: Fixed getStatusRow() to be centered (again).

2003-05-22 23:02  patrick

	* CC_FieldManager.php: Fixed getDisplayName() to not lowercase the
	$column variable in case there wasn't an entry in the $columnData
	array. If you do a select nnnn as Mmmm, it was returning mmmm
	instead of Mmmm. This is fixed.

2003-05-22 22:57  patrick

	* CC_Buttons/CC_Sort_Button.php: A couple of double quotes were
	left there by mistake. It broke stuff.

2003-05-22 17:42  mike

	* CC_Summary.php: added keys to the number or rows per page select
	list. if you specified a default number of rows per page number not
	in the original select list, it will be added to the select list
	and sorted.

2003-05-22 17:18  patrick

	* CC_Summary.php (version-1): Added CC_Config variable
	$dwDefaultRecordsPerPage to set the default number of rows per
	page.

2003-05-22 17:16  patrick

	number of rows per page.

2003-05-22 17:14  patrick

	page in CC_Config. See $dwDefaultRecordsPerPage.

2003-05-22 17:07  mike

	* CC_Summary.php: fixed the bug when there are fewer records than
	the starting record number. It now sets page back to 1.

2003-05-22 16:44  patrick

	* CC_Utilities.php: Added getApplication() to make it easier to get
	the application object from within a function and whatnot.

2003-05-22 14:21  mike

	* CC_Database.php: added 4 methods. doQuery (maps to doUpdate),
	begin, rollback and commit (all map to doUpdate with 'begin',
	'rollback', and 'commit' queries)

2003-05-22 11:46  patrick

	* CC_Summary.php: IMPORANT CHANGE THAT WILL BREAK THINGS! Changed
	the constructor so you do *not* pass in the window object. It now
	gets it internally from $application->getCurrentWindow().

2003-05-21 19:58  patrick

	* CC_FieldManager.php: Fixed things to work if your CC_FIELDS table
	is empty.

2003-05-21 19:56  patrick

	* CC_Buttons/CC_Sort_Button.php: Had already fixed the style
	problem, but forgot to check it in... My changes did things in a
	more flexible way, plus I changed double quotes to single.

2003-05-21 17:07  mike

	* CC_Database.php, CC_Record.php, cc_styles.css,
	CC_Summaries/CC_Ordered_Summary.php,
	CC_Windows/CC_Add_FK_Record_Window.php,
	CC_Windows/CC_Add_Ordered_Record_Window.php,
	CC_Windows/CC_Add_Record_Window.php,
	CC_Windows/CC_Delete_Confirm_Window.php,
	CC_Windows/CC_Delete_Multiple_Confirm_Window.php,
	CC_Windows/CC_Delete_Ordered_Confirm_Window.php,
	CC_Windows/CC_Edit_Ordered_Record_Window.php,
	CC_Windows/CC_Edit_Record_Window.php,
	CC_Windows/CC_Manage_FK_Table_Window.php,
	CC_Windows/CC_OneToMany_Window.php,
	CC_Windows/CC_Remove_File_Confirmation_Window.php,
	CC_Windows/CC_View_Ordered_Record_Window.php,
	CC_Windows/CC_View_Record_Window.php: fixed stylesheets for
	'ccSummaryHeadings'

2003-05-21 16:54  mike

	* CC_Buttons/CC_Sort_Button.php: changed the sort-button style.

2003-05-21 16:33  mike

	* CC_Database.php: Didn't need to parse the tableName from the
	query in the doOrderedInsert method. tableName was already passed
	as an argument.

2003-05-21 16:30  mike

	* CC_Database.php: Added a method getLastInsertId that takes the
	tableName (parsed from the query) as an argument, which returns the
	last inserted id for both mysql and postgres.

2003-05-21 16:03  mike

	* CC_Fields/CC_OneToMany_Field.php: reverted... some of the places
	where I am calling doInsert doesn't have the tablename... Patrick,
	i need help using regular expressions to grab the table name from
	the insert query.

2003-05-21 16:00  mike

	* CC_Fields/CC_OneToMany_Field.php: passed the table name to
	doInsert along with the query. This is so I can get the last
	inserted id.

2003-05-21 15:24  mike

	* CC_Record.php: fixed queries so that the mysql md5 function will
	instead use php md5 method.

2003-05-21 15:20  mike

	* CC_Record.php: made the buildInsertQuery method database aware.
	Postgres will generate ID values through its sequence, mysql will
	use auto_increment.

2003-05-21 14:57  mike

	* CC_Database.php: made the default $databaseTypeString = 'mysql'
	in the constructor.

2003-05-21 14:36  jamie

	* CC_Action_Handler.php, CC_Application.php, CC_Button.php,
	CC_Index.php, CC_Handlers/CC_Delete_Confirm_Handler.php,
	CC_Handlers/CC_Delete_Ordered_Confirm_Handler.php,
	CC_Handlers/CC_Insert_FK_Record_Handler.php,
	CC_Handlers/CC_Insert_Ordered_Record_Handler.php,
	CC_Handlers/CC_Insert_Record_Handler.php,
	CC_Handlers/CC_Remove_File_Confirmation_Handler.php,
	CC_Handlers/CC_Save_Record_Handler.php,
	CC_Handlers/CC_Update_OneToMany_Handler.php,
	CC_Handlers/CC_Update_Record_Handler.php: added check for multiple
	clicks... now $multipleClick is passed to handlers (default =
	false) so they can decide how to handle this. I already implemented
	logic to catch the obvious one's where records are added or deleted
	or updated

2003-05-21 14:15  mike

	* CC_Utilities.php: updated getFieldListFromTable method to make
	sure that excluded fields are case insensitive. To exclude ID field
	simply pass ID (no need to pass lower-case versions)

2003-05-21 12:34  patrick

	* CC_Buttons/CC_Text_Button.php: Changed some double quotes to
	single quotes.

2003-05-21 12:32  patrick

	* CC_Window.php: Changes some double quotes to single quotes.

2003-05-20 15:55  mike

	display status row on the bottom of the summary too.

2003-05-20 15:34  mike

	* CC_Fields/CC_Checkbox_Field.php: switched value from 'true',
	'false' to 1, 0. Added a getViewHTML method to return 'Yes' when
	checked, 'No' when unchecked.

2003-05-20 15:24  mike

	* CC_Windows/CC_View_Record_Window.php: switched double quotes to
	single.

	* CC_Utilities.php: switched getFieldListFromTable method to be
	database independent.

2003-05-20 15:20  mike

	* CC_Record.php: made the fields array have uppercase keys, the
	getField method doesn't care which case is passed (it will convert
	to uppercase)

2003-05-20 15:16  mike

	* CC_FieldManager.php: fixed all upper case field keys in
	cc_fieldmanager to lowercase so that fields can be used by both
	mysql and postgres.

2003-05-20 15:11  mike

	* CC_Database.php: Added two methods cc_show_tables and
	cc_get_fields. These methods replace database depend SQL "show
	tables" and "desc <table>"

2003-05-20 12:17  patrick

	* CC_Window.php: Fixed the constructor to work properly without an
	argument. CC_Window will now also produce an error message if you
	construct it with an argument. This is to bring attention to code
	that needs to be fixed.

2003-05-20 11:51  patrick

	* CC_Config.php: Improved documentation for cookie/session expiry
	stuff.

2003-05-19 23:23  patrick

	* CC_Handlers/CC_Delete_Multiple_Records_Handler.php: Fixed
	CC_Record constructor.

2003-05-19 23:20  patrick

	* CC_Button.php: CC_Handlers can now return false to break out of a
	chain of handler processing. That is, if multiple handlers are
	registered with a button, and one in the middle returns false due
	to an error, the remaining handlers are no longer executed.

2003-05-19 18:01  patrick

	* _TABLE_DEFINITIONS.txt, _TABLE_DEFINITIONS_MYSQL.txt,
	_TABLE_DEFINITIONS_POSTGRES.txt: Added a Postgres CC tables
	definition file and renamed the default one to be MySQL-specific.

2003-05-19 17:01  patrick

	* CC_Database.php: Unset the databaseObject in closeDatabase() so
	that a dead object doesn't get stored in the session.

2003-05-19 16:59  patrick

	* CC_Database.php: We now only construct the datasource string once
	rather than every time openDatabase() is called.

2003-05-19 16:15  patrick

	* cc_styles.css: Fixed style names so that they work (put a dot in
	front of them).

2003-05-19 16:15  patrick

	* .htaccess: Allow access to cc_styles.css

2003-05-19 16:14  patrick

	* CC_Summary.php: Minor style change for ccSummaryHeadings.

2003-05-19 15:53  patrick

	CC_Windows/CC_Edit_Record_Window.php,
	CC_Windows/CC_View_Ordered_Record_Window.php,
	CC_Windows/CC_View_Record_Window.php: Fixed all the CC_Record
	constructors.

2003-05-19 15:49  mike

	* CC_Summary.php: missed a dot.

2003-05-19 15:29  patrick

	* cc_styles.css: Default stylesheet. Can be included, or used as a
	reference to override.

2003-05-19 15:22  patrick

	* CC_Window.php, CC_Field.php: Standardized style names -- see
	cc_styles.css for a list of used styles.

2003-05-19 15:20  patrick

	* CC_Summary.php: Standardized style names -- see cc_styles.css for
	a list of used styles. Also replaced sprintf() function calls in
	favour of dot concatenation.

2003-05-18 15:00  patrick

	* CC_Index.php: Removed a duplicate (!) check for redirectURL.

2003-05-16 00:24  patrick

	* CC_Application.php, CC_Handlers/CC_Save_Record_Handler.php:
	Removed $application->databaseObject complete. Use $application->db
	instead.

2003-05-16 00:14  patrick

	* CC_Index.php: IMPORTANT: N2O no longer checks for the application
	class or the _RequireOnceFiles.php in the application folder. If
	your application uses either of these files, move all required
	files (including the application class) into a folder called
	"required".

2003-05-16 00:04  patrick

	* ChangeLog: Updated ChangeLog

2003-05-16 00:01  patrick

	* CC_FieldManager.php: Until we automatically create the CC_FIELDS
	table, CC_FieldManager will now always know about ID, DATE_ADDED
	and LAST_MODIFIED.

	* CC_FieldManager.php, CC_RelationshipManager.php, CC_Summary.php,
	CC_Utilities.php, CC_Window.php, CC_Fields/CC_OneToMany_Field.php,
	CC_Summaries/CC_Ordered_Summary.php: fixes 'a plenty.

	remove need for $rowNumber...

	"cleaned up") the whole require_once() process. There were many
	occurrences of files require_once()-ing files that had already been
	included and such. I asked Rasmus Lerdorf, the original creator of
	PHP tonight how the require_once() function knows if it has already
	required a file. He told me that it did it pretty inefficiently
	(stat()-ing the file, building a list...). It got me thinking about
	all the require_once() statements we have, so I went through and
	cleaned things up.
	
	I used a benchmarking tool to locate what was taking the longest to
	execute. If you're interested in profiling stuff locally, install
	the Benchmark PEAR module:
	
	pear install Benchmark
	
	(Jamie, you'll need to install PHP 4.3.x to do this.)
	
	You can then add to your code:
	
	require_once('Benchmark/Timer.php'); $timer = new
	Benchmark_Timer(); $timer->start(); ...  $timer->setMarker('Marker
	1'); ...  $timer->setMarker('Marker n'); ...  $timer->stop();
	$timer->display();
	
	The output will show how long each marker took, and what percentage
	of the overall time did it use. We should do this in all of our
	classes for N2O, as it will help us achieve nitro speeds.

2003-04-15 15:54  mike

	* CC_Fields/CC_File_Upload_ToPath_Field.php: added a small icon
	(the cc_summary_view icon), and removed the border=1.

	required.

2003-03-17 13:33  patrick

	* CC_Field.php, CC_Fields/CC_Expiry_Date_Field.php: Fields can now
	declare that they should not be validated if they have a value but
	are not required. The Expiry Date is currently the only field that
	will always have a value, but that isn't to say more will be added
	in the future -- maybe not into CC_Framework, but custom fields in
	particular.

2003-03-14 13:05  mike

	* CC_Summaries/CC_Ordered_Summary.php: made this a proper subclass

2003-03-14 13:05  mike

	getSummaryControlRow, getDownloadButton. The getHTML now only gets

	* CC_Summary.php: Brand spanking new CC_Summary, this fixes

2003-03-13 13:26  jamie

	* CC_Handlers/CC_Update_Record_Handler.php: Now if you pass false
	as the second argument, the update handler will not set the
	application's action to anything. This is useful for situations
	where you want to have "Save" and a "Save and Close" buttons on a
	record update screen.

2003-03-06 17:52  patrick

	* CC_Fields/: CC_PostalCode_Field.php, CC_PostalZipCode_Field.php,

2003-02-24 19:59  mike

	* CC_Fields/CC_Time_Field.php: made sure to call the parent

	did the trick.

	CC_Windows/CC_View_Ordered_Record_Window.php,
	CC_Windows/CC_View_Record_Window.php: Added ability to better
	customize default windows.
	
	If you define a variable called 'window_class' in your CC_Config
	which specifies an alternate window class to use (a sub-class of
	CC_Window), the default windows will use the alternate class
	instead of CC_Window.
	
	Furthermore, I added two new methods to CC_Window: getHeader() and
	getFooter(). These methods get called at the beginning and end of
	the default windows, respectively. Your sub-class can override
	these methods to add in a navigation bar or what-have-you. See
	EMedia_Window of the "_projectmanager" project for an example of
	this in action.

2003-02-16 14:23  patrick

2003-02-15 18:01  patrick

	* CC_Utilities.php: Updated requireAllFilesInFolder() to be safer.
	Sure would have been nice to receive an email letting us know that

	folder! It took a bunch of debugging to find out why nothing was
	working, and even crashed my browser a bunch of times.

2003-02-15 17:58  patrick

	necessary.

2003-02-14 13:18  mike

2003-02-13 12:34  mike

	* CC_Handlers/CC_Insert_Record_Handler.php: Added
	getInsertedRecordId() method so we can get the record ID of the
	inserted record. (call this method AFTER calling the process()
	method)

2003-02-12 13:44  mike

	* CC_Application.php: removed reference in 'setArgument' so I could
	pass values and not only variables. (For instance you can now pass
	'', or "test" as the value to an argument)

2003-02-12 13:33  mike

	* CC_Record.php: modified the radioButton field to select the
